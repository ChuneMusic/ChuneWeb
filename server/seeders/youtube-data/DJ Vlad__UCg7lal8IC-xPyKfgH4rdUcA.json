He explains how shareholders can receive dividend payments by electing to get paid in cash or opting for a dividend reinvestment plan or DRP (pronounced drip). This plan reinvests the dividends a shareholder earned in order to gain more stock in particular company. \n\nDJ Vlad then breaks down what growth stocks are and the types of companies that fall under this category. He explains how these companies don't divvy out dividends but rather reinvest the profits into the company which in turn is supposed to raise the stock price. He also remarks that despite companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix being growth stocks, they'll eventually begin dishing out dividends after gaining enough of a market share.\n\n--------------\n\nDisclaimer: DJ Vlad is not a financial advisor.

He said \"Financial literacy is one of the biggest issues that plague our society. 90% of crimes committed are money related, yet only 1% of the programs that cater to people in prison and out deal with finance. I am here to be a solution for that, at least from my perspective.\"\n\nKnown as the \"Oracle of San Quentin\", Curtis Caroll was convicted of murder/robbery 20 years ago and was sentenced to 54 years to life behind bars at an age when most of us were busy going on awkward dates as we attempted to navigate high school.\n\nCurtis came up in what can be considered ground zero of the crack epidemic; Oakland, California. Carroll's desire to change his circumstance forced him to educate himself and at the same time awakened a conscious he long ago buried under multiple rap sheets as a youth. \n\nCarroll now sees his life as an opportunity to teach financial literacy the masses, attributing crime, or the motive behind it, directly to the disconnect between financial security and most people. He compares finance to a soap opera in that he attempts to find a narrative to which people are emotionally connected to, and determines his move based on that. Salute to Curtis Carroll and Sway for an important interview.

Most rappers who make it big become somewhat ubiquitous and Bow Wow attributes that to hard work. \n\nHe went on to discuss his time at Cash Money, and what he took away from the experience despite not putting out an official body of work under the label.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYrNtg9e0JU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYrNtg9e0JU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYrNtg9e0JU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYrNtg9e0JU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYrNtg9e0JU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"djvlad","playlistId":"UUg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","position":778,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"iYrNtg9e0JU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/AGTe-5jFseI5wL-9Kctq9E1xtoM\"","id":"VVVnN2xhbDhJQy14UHlLZmdINHJkVWNBLjlUaE1udHprUTNB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-26T20:10:19.000Z","channelId":"UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","title":"Gervonta Davis on Starting Boxing at 7, Becoming Silver Gloves Champion at 10 (Part 2)","description":"Watch Part 7: https://goo.gl/J2EiRT  \nPart 6:  https://goo.gl/3u3EWM  \nPart 5: https://goo.gl/CQNhXC \nPart 4: https://goo.gl/FHXHso   \nPart 3: https://goo.gl/JDjFnv\nPart 1: https://goo.gl/scwoSf\n_________________________\nIn this clip, Gervonta Davis talked about his start in boxing.

The conversation builds off of DJ Vlad querying R.A. on social media sensation Lil Pump. R.A. admitted that he's not familiar with Lil Pump or his music and that in order to offer a fair assessment of him as an artist would have to delve deeper. Particularly when it comes to performing. R.A. said he'd have to see Pump on stage for at least an hour before casting judgment. He also believes that rocking the stage is a connection and energy the performer has with the audience stating that someone could have a terrible song but rock the live performance. \n\nR.A. also breaks down the psychology behind sampling or remixing familiar tracks. To R.A. the familiarity of a record lends itself to being listened to more if there is a sample most people know. He pointed to MC Hammer's \"Can't Touch This\" for its use of Rick James hit \"Superfreak\" and how he used a similar tactic when freestyling over Taylor Swift's track. The familiarity mainstream America had with Swift's original made people listen to R.A.'s version.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HawehxJCh5E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HawehxJCh5E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HawehxJCh5E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HawehxJCh5E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HawehxJCh5E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"djvlad","playlistId":"UUg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","position":1141,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HawehxJCh5E"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/dF5rtlzK2WcFUA6xV6Z5-Tk0M-U\"","id":"VVVnN2xhbDhJQy14UHlLZmdINHJkVWNBLkM1cHJHNzBhQmF3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-04T18:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","title":"Cookie Money on Accumulating Felonies, Beating Serious Gun Case (Part 2)","description":"Part 1: https://goo.gl/ffsa13\nPart 3: https://goo.gl/wgHkQQ\nPart 4: https://goo.gl/bVjt69\nPart 5: https://goo.gl/62T5rE\nPart 6: https://goo.gl/5YY49W\nPart 7: https://goo.gl/iwmiGw\nPart 8: https://goo.gl/gg7dms\n_____________________________________\nEast Oakland rapper Cookie Money spoke to VladTV about getting involved in the streets as a teenager, watching friends get killed, and hiding everything from his family and making it seem like he was living a normal life.

According to Rock, the friction stemmed from a Top Dog lyric on an OGC track that Biggie appropriated for the \"Get Money\" remix. Rock was very direct when claiming that the beef indeed stemmed from that incident because it went against the rules of hip-hop. Rock spoke about the importance of originality and why stealing that line was so egregious. Rock also took responsibility for the \"No Fear\" video which saw Biggie and his wife Faith Evans parodied. He stated that the situation did escalate and became violent but \"nobody died.\" \n\nRock transitioned away from the Junior Mafia beef and discussed Heltah Skeltah's second album Magnum Force and how the group inevitably disbanded. He spoke of how the universe forced him to go solo when he got various signs pointing him in that direction. Rock told of how Ruck mentioned going solo, the dissolution of the relationship between Priority Records and Duck Down, and his ex-girlfriend working at Violator Records all led him to embarking on his solo career.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaC35uZIBYQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaC35uZIBYQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaC35uZIBYQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaC35uZIBYQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaC35uZIBYQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"djvlad","playlistId":"UUg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","position":1209,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xaC35uZIBYQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/VmlG-qSphBPUvJXMFghNEch9BSA\"","id":"VVVnN2xhbDhJQy14UHlLZmdINHJkVWNBLk9ucmlKcFROejFR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-20T18:47:37.000Z","channelId":"UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","title":"NOI's Wesley Muhammad: Malcolm X was in Violation of \"Black-God Protocol\" (Part 7)","description":"Watch Part 6: https://goo.gl/U9r4KG \nPart 5: https://goo.gl/5tdrpD \nPart 4: https://goo.gl/e2kRws \nPart 3: https://goo.gl/X3dzXx \nPart 2: https://goo.gl/94F99z\nPart 1: https://goo.gl/GccSWs\n_______________________________\nIn this clip, Dr. Wesley Muhammad discussed the lasting legacy of Malcolm X in the context of the Nation of Islam.

Muhammad says Obama was unable to be an alpha male or a \"Black Boss\" but he did say that the current U.S. President is a white alpha male. \n\nDr. Wesley Muhammad also called out the government for what he calls the false flag operation that bestowed blame of the 9/11 on Osama Bin Laden. Although Muhammad doesn't agree with Bin Laden's terrorist ideology, he drove home the idea of a hidden hand being at play.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r4dqlwVWPQA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r4dqlwVWPQA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r4dqlwVWPQA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r4dqlwVWPQA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r4dqlwVWPQA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"djvlad","playlistId":"UUg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","position":1237,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"r4dqlwVWPQA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Tubz4dY30ppOJrPI_1u4r9C-xEI\"","id":"VVVnN2xhbDhJQy14UHlLZmdINHJkVWNBLlJlYUFzVWI5d3N3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-13T19:15:44.000Z","channelId":"UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","title":"Bali Baby on First Dating Guys But Realizing She's Lesbian at 17 (Part 2)","description":"Part 1: https://goo.gl/cEMyc5\nPart 3: https://goo.gl/byFyLB\nPart 4: https://goo.gl/YotqzR\n\n____________________________________\nBali Baby opened up to VladTV about being the first feminine lesbian rapper in hip-hop and when she first started dating girls.

However, he described the feeling he got listening to \"Hit Em Up\" in the club and the chills that the track sent through his body. Kirkland said that you could feel the hate. Needless to say, T.K. wasn't ready to tag one track as better than other so he decided to give them a 50/50 split.

Lord Jamar agreed with Cube and seconded his reasoning. He went onto say that \"No Vaseline\" had \"realer sh*t\" adding that some of Pac's comments hadn't been verified. Lord Jamar went on to make the point that Pac benefitted from the visual aspect of the diss with the music video that no doubt added insult to injury.

This pushed Dizzy to consider whether Juvenile could be in that category because he said things that Dizzy couldn't decipher back in 1996.

According to Cyhi, \"once you've bodied rap\" then a team of collaborators is necessary to compete with other genres of music. In a sense, Cyhi argues that transcending hip-hop into mainstream status dictates that you have a team of creatives in order to produce high-quality music at that \"grammy level.\" All of this despite hip-hop's insistence on rappers writing their own lyrics and telling their own stories, but Cyhi made the point that some of your favorite rappers don't have stories to carry them for 6 albums.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LqIc1vjF7W4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LqIc1vjF7W4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LqIc1vjF7W4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LqIc1vjF7W4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LqIc1vjF7W4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"djvlad","playlistId":"UUg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","position":1302,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"LqIc1vjF7W4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/N6NeFbOTZmMK_ObNUOxlpYs9QQY\"","id":"VVVnN2xhbDhJQy14UHlLZmdINHJkVWNBLjc4RXljdkliaks4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-28T19:22:48.000Z","channelId":"UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","title":"T.K.

Hughley goes in on the existence of God and his personal reasons for believing in a higher power.

To D.L., the concept of God could be intrinsic, but considering the history of America and how religion was used as a tool of oppression, it could be indoctrination as well. Hughley points out that you'll be hard pressed finding a Black atheist which could also be a byproduct of indoctrination. According to D.L. Hughley, the Black church is \"the gayest place on the face of the earth.

Schulz also offered his two cents on Kevin Durant's claim that Kyrie Irving is a better player than Allen Iverson by saying that's an accurate comparison yet Iverson was more of a defensive force. Andrew Schulz also took this time to heap praise upon LeBron James calling him the greatest teammate and motivator of all time. He also believes LeBron should win the Most Valuable Player Award every year he continues to play in the league and he backed up his claim by laying out LeBron's on-court productivity along with his intangible attributes.
