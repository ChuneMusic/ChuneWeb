His single “Betrayed” is 62 million views and counting. \n\nIn this episode of Noisey Raps, we return to his hometown neighborhood in Redlands, California and he shows us where he came from, and where he hopes to go.\n\nWATCH NEXT: From SoundCloud to Success with Post Malone -\n https://vice.video/2jXp0J9\n\nYou Should Subscribe Here Now: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\n**\nSubscribe to Noisey on YouTube to stay updated on our daily releases: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://www.noisey.com\nLike Noisey on Facebook: http://fb.com/noisey\nFollow Noisey on Twitter: http://twitter.com/noiseymusic\nRead our tumblr: http://noiseymusic.tumblr.com\nCheck out our Instagram:http://instagram.com/noisey\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGLpAdzqGtk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGLpAdzqGtk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGLpAdzqGtk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGLpAdzqGtk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGLpAdzqGtk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Noisey","playlistId":"UU0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","position":21,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"LGLpAdzqGtk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/ha_t0jwLC5eb2OX_2fmrGYQUsMg\"","id":"VVUwaXdIUkZwdjJfZnBvalpnUWhFbEVRLkdwWkZGLUJIbF9j","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-13T11:32:38.000Z","channelId":"UC0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","title":"67 x The Night Skinny - 'On Tour' (Official Video)","description":"Noisey is proud to present the new visual from the stars of our recent ‘Don’t Call It Road Rap’ documentary 67 with production from The Night Skinny.

His use of the guitar as both a weapon and a hook machine has been the blueprint the past three decades of alternative rock, and his violent use of effects pedals is the stuff of countless gearheads' wet dreams. \n\nThat sound of technical skills seamlessly blended with equal parts unhinged noise and heart breaking hooks set up the commercial success of bands like Nirvana and the Pixies. In this episode of Guitar Moves, Matt Sweeney has a action packed hang with the guitar wizard—who’s traditionally not super talkative in interviews—and Mascis shines light on the origins of his guitar playing, Dinosaur Jr.’s influential sound, and gives an up close look at some of his favorite guitar moves.\n\nWATCH MORE GUITAR MOVES: https://vice.video/2nhegtl\n\nYou Should Subscribe Here Now: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\n**\nSubscribe to Noisey on YouTube to stay updated on our daily releases: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://www.noisey.com\nLike Noisey on Facebook: http://fb.com/noisey\nFollow Noisey on Twitter: http://twitter.com/noiseymusic\nRead our tumblr: http://noiseymusic.tumblr.com\nCheck out our Instagram:http://instagram.com/noisey\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/auaNmXyO6ZU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/auaNmXyO6ZU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/auaNmXyO6ZU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/auaNmXyO6ZU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/auaNmXyO6ZU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Noisey","playlistId":"UU0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","position":26,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"auaNmXyO6ZU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/cbp4iK8t8TRyS84hNu5-zMd_4a0\"","id":"VVUwaXdIUkZwdjJfZnBvalpnUWhFbEVRLlNYUWJnTzF2SmpB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-21T12:04:55.000Z","channelId":"UC0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","title":"Omar Souleyman - 'Es-Samra' (Official Video)","description":"Noisey presents the visuals for Omar Souleyman's 'Es-Samra'.\n\nThe single is Omar's love letter to Istanbul, taken from his third studio album 'To Syria, With Love'.

But she didn’t always want that. “I was not a social person and I was not a person who saw myself as someone who wanted to be, like, in the spotlight or have people constantly telling me about myself,” she says. “I didn’t want any of that. That’s why I never wanted to be in that world; I wanted to be behind the camera.” \n\nIn this Noisey Next video, Uchis tells us about her rise from photography-obsessed student to internationally-recognized pop singer. And she states her ambition clearly: “Eventually I feel like my goal is definitely global domination. But whether I get there this year or next year or in four years, who’s to say?”\n\nYou Should Subscribe Here Now: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\n**\nSubscribe to Noisey on YouTube to stay updated on our daily releases: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://www.noisey.com\nLike Noisey on Facebook: http://fb.com/noisey\nFollow Noisey on Twitter: http://twitter.com/noiseymusic\nRead our tumblr: http://noiseymusic.tumblr.com\nCheck out our Instagram:http://instagram.com/noisey\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HY0W_HMAwwA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HY0W_HMAwwA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HY0W_HMAwwA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HY0W_HMAwwA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HY0W_HMAwwA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Noisey","playlistId":"UU0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","position":29,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HY0W_HMAwwA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/iuEFJEN1oQhol7vG5WpMgtzQGwc\"","id":"VVUwaXdIUkZwdjJfZnBvalpnUWhFbEVRLldsbWRzc19MX05n","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-17T12:28:10.000Z","channelId":"UC0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","title":"Kurupt FM - The Lost Tape Documentary","description":"Noisey presents a new documentary from Kurupt FM.\n\nToday is the day the music world has been waiting for.

Once lost in a backpack in deepest Brentford, the Lost Tape has now been uncovered, remixed and mastered for the very first time.\n\nIt only seemed right to couple the release of the legendary tape with a documentary from legendary filmmaker Ewen Spencer, featuring Mike Skinner, Rodigan, P Money, Scott Garcia and Sticky. Known for his scene-defining piece ‘Brandy & Coke’ and having previously worked with the likes of The Streets and Massive Attack, Ewen Spencer had the privilege to take his art to the next level with the honour of documenting the legend of the Lost Tape.\n\nDirected by Ewen Spencer \nProduction Company: My Accomplice\n\nCatch Kurupt FM live at the following locations:\n17 Nov - Oxford, O2 Academy\n18 Nov - Bristol, Motion\n24 Nov - Edinburgh, La Belle Angele\n25 Nov - Glasgow, SWG3\n\nBuy Now: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/kurupt-fm-present-the-lost-tape/1312108944 …\n\nhttp://www.kuruptfm.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/KuruptFM\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kuruptfm\n\nKurupt FM - The Lost Tape, the album, is available here now: http://x-l-r.co/thelosttape\n\nDirected by Ewen Spencer\n\nYou Should Subscribe Here Now: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\n**\nSubscribe to Noisey on YouTube to stay updated on our daily releases: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://www.noisey.com\nLike Noisey on Facebook: http://fb.com/noisey\nFollow Noisey on Twitter: http://twitter.com/noiseymusic\nRead our tumblr: http://noiseymusic.tumblr.com\nCheck out our Instagram:http://instagram.com/noisey\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wlmdss_L_Ng/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wlmdss_L_Ng/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wlmdss_L_Ng/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wlmdss_L_Ng/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wlmdss_L_Ng/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Noisey","playlistId":"UU0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","position":30,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Wlmdss_L_Ng"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/teOmaqmKGZleLvD9aQUrR7ADk2o\"","id":"VVUwaXdIUkZwdjJfZnBvalpnUWhFbEVRLnR3OTB3VWExYk9r","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-07T18:45:43.000Z","channelId":"UC0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","title":"Kurt Vile & Courtney Barnett Break Down Their Biggest Songs: Guitar Moves","description":"Kurt Vile and Courtney Barnett are a dream pairing, who very well may have one of the best albums of 2017​ with the '​Lotta Sea Lice.'

However we will fight anyone who denies that Liverpool’s Michael Head is one of the finest songwriters that the UK has ever produced.\n\nHe is the subject of the latest episode of this Noisey series that has featured everyone from Noel Gallagher and Goldie to Johnny Marr and Tricky.\n\nIn host John Doran’s own words, “He has a discography recorded with The Pale Fountains, Shack and more recently The Red Elastic Band, that most songwriters would kill for. A lifetime of poor luck with record labels, the shifting tastes of the record buying public and long standing issues with drink and drugs means that he has never found the audience he deserves. Even if it’s by accident however, Mick has ended up playing the long game and future generations will come to regard him as some kind of genius, even if it’s currently a view only shared by his small but rabidly loyal fanbase.\"\n\nWATCH MORE EPISODES OF THE BRITISH MASTERS \nRoots Manuva: https://youtu.be/XtMidSvOBLE\nMark E Smith: https://youtu.be/FBvG9zsQrPo\nJohn Lydon: https://youtu.be/MjnjJrogb3Q\nJohnny Marr: https://youtu.be/jIHbCjop4aw\nLiam Gallagher: https://youtu.be/QPTkbaq7mUY\n\nYou Should Subscribe Here Now: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\n**\nSubscribe to Noisey on YouTube to stay updated on our daily releases: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://www.noisey.com\nLike Noisey on Facebook: http://fb.com/noisey\nFollow Noisey on Twitter: http://twitter.com/noiseymusic\nRead our tumblr: http://noiseymusic.tumblr.com\nCheck out our Instagram:http://instagram.com/noisey\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4aQ3XEQmsno/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4aQ3XEQmsno/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4aQ3XEQmsno/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Noisey","playlistId":"UU0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","position":33,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4aQ3XEQmsno"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/h3AFIQ04Oras-kCfz5L52UmzLYQ\"","id":"VVUwaXdIUkZwdjJfZnBvalpnUWhFbEVRLmlPaG1WZE8zQTZF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-16T13:13:29.000Z","channelId":"UC0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","title":"J2K Feat.

90s R&B Still Reigns Supreme in 2017","description":"Black history is American history, especially when it comes to music. African-American musical traditions set in motion a culture that's given us Jazz, the Blues, Rock n Roll, Funk, Disco, Soul, and Hip Hop.\n\nDespite this evolution, for much of the 20th Century “Rhythm & Blues” was a blanket term applied to any music marketed to black audiences, changing meaning with each era. As Hip Hop entered the picture artists like Teddy Riley, Jodeci, and members of New Edition incorporated the new sound and style into a classic R&B template.

Rex - dominated the pop charts, America’s Glam movement manifested in the form of Iggy Pop, New York Dolls, and The Velvet Underground; giving birth to a durable Rock ’n Roll aesthetic template to be embraced or rejected for decades to come.\n\nUnder The Influence shows how Glam Rock’s legacy helped give us Disco, Goth, Hair Metal, Prince, KISS, REM, Twin Shadow, Lady Gaga, filmmaker Todd Haynes, LGBT rights, platform boots, and a generation of young artists in the developing world reimagining life as art.\n\nListen to Noisey's Glam Rock mixtape on Pandora: http://pdora.co/2qNiQiU\n\nYou Should Subscribe Here Now: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\n**\nSubscribe to Noisey on YouTube to stay updated on our daily releases: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://www.noisey.com\nLike Noisey on Facebook: http://fb.com/noisey\nFollow Noisey on Twitter: http://twitter.com/noiseymusic\nRead our tumblr: http://noiseymusic.tumblr.com\nCheck out our Instagram:http://instagram.com/noisey\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/po-UlqG1x7Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/po-UlqG1x7Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/po-UlqG1x7Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/po-UlqG1x7Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/po-UlqG1x7Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Noisey","playlistId":"UU0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","position":65,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"po-UlqG1x7Y"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/8-S3paWKWTmO_3HNw8mga5JW9b0\"","id":"VVUwaXdIUkZwdjJfZnBvalpnUWhFbEVRLm55THdOakhlaVFR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-05-19T11:04:00.000Z","channelId":"UC0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","title":"CASISDEAD - \"The Grid\" (Official Video)","description":"Noisey favourite CASISDEAD brings you the visuals for his latest single 'The Grid', produced by Cyrus.\n\nhttp://www.imreallydead.com\n@casisdead\n\nYou Should Subscribe Here Now: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\n**\nSubscribe to Noisey on YouTube to stay updated on our daily releases: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Noisey\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://www.noisey.com\nLike Noisey on Facebook: http://fb.com/noisey\nFollow Noisey on Twitter: http://twitter.com/noiseymusic\nRead our tumblr: http://noiseymusic.tumblr.com\nCheck out our Instagram:http://instagram.com/noisey\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nyLwNjHeiQQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nyLwNjHeiQQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nyLwNjHeiQQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nyLwNjHeiQQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Noisey","playlistId":"UU0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","position":66,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nyLwNjHeiQQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/xucXoit9JzDEhvkoMJjg_xZEChc\"","id":"VVUwaXdIUkZwdjJfZnBvalpnUWhFbEVRLkNlSkZLRkUzbENN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-05-09T14:03:09.000Z","channelId":"UC0iwHRFpv2_fpojZgQhElEQ","title":"No Smoking in The Booth: A Film About Skunk, Grime and Mental Health","description":"As part of Mental Health Awareness Week, Noisey presents 'No Smoking in the Booth' - a documentary about skunk, grime and mental health. \n\nThe film follows grime legend and Boy Better Know member Jammer on his personal journey to understand how skunk may be affecting the mental health of musicians in his scene. \n\nThe potential link between cannabis and mental health problems is a controversial subject.
