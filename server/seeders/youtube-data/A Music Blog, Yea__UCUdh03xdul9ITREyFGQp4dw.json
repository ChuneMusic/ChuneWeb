Dive into the conversation as we discuss incredibly funny fan encounters, almost ending Being the Elite, wanting to air guitar with Hulk Hogan, their first superkicks, and the excitement of ALL IN. \n\n--\n\nFollow AMBY:\n\nhttp://www.amusicblogyea.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AMusicBlogYea\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AliciaAtout\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amusicblogyea/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/aliciaatout/\n\nSubscribe to AMBY ► http://www.youtube.com/amusicblogyea\n\nGet Your AMBY Merch ► http://amusicblogyea.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSScTxIyUsY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSScTxIyUsY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSScTxIyUsY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSScTxIyUsY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSScTxIyUsY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Alicia Atout - AMBY Interviews","playlistId":"UUUdh03xdul9ITREyFGQp4dw","position":23,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"DSScTxIyUsY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/D5vy63Nus9qwSiAxcsgYcFZNKCM\"","id":"VVVVZGgwM3hkdWw5SVRSRXlGR1FwNGR3LlZyLW9qbnZzMkNJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-31T16:47:28.000Z","channelId":"UCUdh03xdul9ITREyFGQp4dw","title":"Interview with \"The Machine\" Brian Cage (Round Two)","description":"Watch AMBY's exclusive interview with Brian Cage!

This is the first interview I've ever walked out on -- I tried to ignore my guest's comments and be professional to carry on with the interview, but enough was enough. Ahead of his match at Greektown Wrestling in Toronto, I hosted an interview with one of the most insulting and cocky guests on the planet: MJF. I originally really wanted to have MJF on the show as he's a fantastic wrestler but had no idea the interview would go this way. Even after the interview, he took to Twitter to continue mocking me and my interviewing. Now even with as rude as he was, I know how many AMBY fans -- especially under these circumstances -- want to see this interview.

As part of my time spent in Asheville, I had the absolute delight of checking out All Go West Festival. To be honest, I hadn't heard of the festival before or many of the bands performing for that matter as it's a local-fill line-up, so I had no idea what to expect. Let me tell you, All Go West is an absolutely incredible thing.\n\nI walked onto the festival grounds and didn't even realize I had arrived - they pretty much took over West Asheville and I loved that. The first thing I saw was a gas station turned into a makeshift music venue and that immediately blew my mind. The Brew Pump stage, as it was named, showcased a bunch of groovy surf-rock bands and drew a pretty large crowd throwing down their best beach dance moves. This first impression brought out a lot of questions; How cool is this? What else does this festival have? Who else can I check out? Between the outdoor main stage, Brew Pump, and indoor venues, I discovered so many local Asheville bands who are now a part of my daily music mixes.\n\nToday I'm excited to share my interview with Arieh Samson, the man who made this whole thing happen -- All Go West Festival's curator. Dive into our conversation on AMBY as we discuss creating a festival, local bands, dream headliners, and loving Asheville.\n\n--\n\nFollow AMBY:\n\nhttp://www.amusicblogyea.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AMusicBlogYea\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AliciaAtout\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amusicblogyea/\n\nSubscribe to AMBY ► http://www.youtube.com/amusicblogyea\n\nGet Your AMBY Merch ► http://amusicblogyea.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9AiSUfeGOYI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9AiSUfeGOYI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9AiSUfeGOYI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9AiSUfeGOYI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9AiSUfeGOYI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Alicia Atout - AMBY Interviews","playlistId":"UUUdh03xdul9ITREyFGQp4dw","position":292,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9AiSUfeGOYI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/RbVIQvBitHxgTYGJyqsYQaqFqrk\"","id":"VVVVZGgwM3hkdWw5SVRSRXlGR1FwNGR3LnBDRXFZQWtXTFo4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-14T00:00:41.000Z","channelId":"UCUdh03xdul9ITREyFGQp4dw","title":"Interview with Grayscale","description":"Watch AMBY's exclusive interview with Grayscale!
