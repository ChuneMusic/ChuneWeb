Located on the corner of 187th Street and Arthur Avenue, the beloved Italian deli is helmed by father-son duo Orazio and Carlo Carciotto. Armed with little more than a pot of boiling water, a few pinches of salt, and an old wooden oar, the Carciottos pride themselves on turning blocks of lifeless cheese curds into molten cascades of creamy mozzarella. The shop is a stalwart in the Belmont section of the Bronx, and Carlo, in particular, was raised in the Italian enclave of Arthur Avenue—a strip of storefronts and restaurants increasingly referred to as NYC's \"real\" Little Italy. In this special installment of Food Skills, Carlo gives a behind-the-scenes tour of one of New York's most legendary neighborhoods, while Orazio breaks down the secrets to his uniquely American success story. In NYC, it's not difficult to a find a delicious pizza margherita, or a mind-blowing chicken parmigiana, but here, at Casa Della Mozzarella, cheese isn't just an ingredient, but a bucket-list meal all its own. \n\nDirector: Jackson Connor\nProducers: Jackson Connor, Tanai Milgram, Dustin Flannery-McCoy\nDirector of Photography: Dustin Flannery-McCoy\nEditor: Dustin Flannery-McCoy\nCamera Operator: David Dominguez \nSound: Michael Moote \nProduction Assistant: Dawn Richard\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/894tMesNxQ4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/894tMesNxQ4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/894tMesNxQ4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"First We Feast","playlistId":"UUPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"894tMesNxQ4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/nTuW8bCTUBDQ2mkvsg6vK0qPNEg\"","id":"VVVQRF9ieENSR3BtbWVRY2JlMmtwUGFBLmhFM0M3VVRwR3Zz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-07-10T15:00:04.000Z","channelId":"UCPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA","title":"This Late-Night Burger Is L.A.'s Secret Handshake | The Burger Show","description":"When the sun sets in Los Angeles and the crowd spills out of Dodger Stadium, that’s when the true spirit of Tommy’s Original World Famous Hamburgers comes to life.

Boiled down for 24 hours, and topped with red-braised beef shanks, the soup is a simple, working-class dish that’s perfectly primed to appease NYC carnivores in 2018.

But at Una Pizza Napoletana, chef Anthony Mangieri is using imported ingredients and traditional cooking techniques to pay homage to his Neapolitan ancestry, all while creating a product that’s uniquely rooted in the five boroughs. Topped with buffalo mozzarella, San Marzano tomato sauce, sea salt from Trapani, and olive oil from Sorrento, each pie from Una Pizza Napoletana is a carefully orchestrated opera of flavor, the pieces blending together to form one perfectly balanced work of art. \n\nA fixture in the NYC slice game for decades, Mangieri made a name for himself as a savant-like pizza purist hellbent on perfection. Today, returning to Manhattan after years on the west coast, the chef just wants to make a pizza that perfectly represents his own unique tastes and experiences. \"For me, at this point in my life, I don’t think the pizza is the best. I think that it’s just mine and it’s what I offer,\" Mangieri says. \"That’s what I bring to New York.

Topped with meat, cheese, and salty, chicharrón-like asiento, tlayudas have a role in Oaxacan cuisine that far exceeds their reputation as \"Mexican pizza.\" Mole—the rich, spice-and-pepper-packed sauce of the region—is used to to drench the tlayudas, as well as chicken, enchiladas, and any other foodstuff within arm's reach. Helmed by second-generation owner Bricia Lopez, Guelaguetza is a bucket-list destination for anyone looking to experience the culture of Oaxaca and L.A. at the same time. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wEj6QwApBf4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wEj6QwApBf4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wEj6QwApBf4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"First We Feast","playlistId":"UUPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA","position":36,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"wEj6QwApBf4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/S3oP9ysB-OvdBttQSwgD9W5GIIE\"","id":"VVVQRF9ieENSR3BtbWVRY2JlMmtwUGFBLlFUNlNPZG5ndTlR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-03T15:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UCPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA","title":"Andrew W.K. and Sean Evans Recreate Pizza Hut Classics | Sean in the Wild","description":"Sean Evans teams up with party legend Andrew W.K. and \"pizza czar\" Anthony Falco for a very special mission: Is it possible to recreate Pizza Hut's most iconic menu items at home?

Though it rarely gets enough shine, the enigmatic \"upside-down\" Sicilian has an answer to these common pizza problems, topping its melted mozzarella with ladles of steaming tomato sauce. Scarr Pimental—the owner of Scarr's Pizza on the Lower East Side—is bringing the city's upside-down Sicilian to the masses, building on a style made famous by NYC pizza masters like L&B Spumoni Gardens in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Crisp, fresh, and packed with flavor, upside-down pizza proves there's no such thing as \"too much sauce\" when it comes to the perfect slice. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMIwlj7bzXA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMIwlj7bzXA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMIwlj7bzXA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"First We Feast","playlistId":"UUPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA","position":153,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"wMIwlj7bzXA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/OWicSAVy7VsbRhn0-1pJSEPJMNs\"","id":"VVVQRF9ieENSR3BtbWVRY2JlMmtwUGFBLllyT2JiSlpfUldv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-03T19:00:05.000Z","channelId":"UCPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA","title":"This 36-Ounce Ribeye Is a Thing of Beauty | Food Skills","description":"As restaurants continue to trend towards refinement and restraint, NYC's the Cannibal specializes in abundance.
