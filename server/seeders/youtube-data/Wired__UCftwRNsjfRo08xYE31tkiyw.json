Nuclear vortex turbines, supercell chambers, stun cores, and collision chambers are just a few of the many various power cores that energize Jaegers.\r\n\r\n#38 What are Jaegers made of?\r\nA wide range of metals are used in the construction of Jaegers including but not limited to steel, iron, brass, obsidian alloys, and much more.\r\n\r\n#37 In Pacific Rim about how many feet tall were the Jaegers?\r\nJaegers vary in height but most are within a range of approximately 250 feet to 300 feet tall.\r\n\r\n#35 Are the game grumps going to be in PAC RIM?\r\nAs great as they were in Pacific Rim – Training Day, sadly they will not be appearing in the film.\r\n\r\n#34 Where do Kaiju come from?\r\nThe Kaiju are sent to Earth from the Anteverse, which is the nexus between dimensions – a unique space that exists beyond all dimensions.\r\n\r\n#32 Are the Kaiju actually a metaphor for describing sea level rise and the risks of global climate change?\r\nThere is a long history in pop culture of monsters embodying the fears of their age. The Kaiju in Pacific Rim are no different.\r\n\r\n#24 How many Kaiju are there?\r\nTo date, dozens of Kaiju have breached our world, but there could be infinitely more being created in the Anteverse. \r\n\r\n#22 Are Kaiju dinosaurs Pacific Rim? \r\nThere are many theories on the Kaiju and the Precursors that are still unproven, including several on a possible link to the dinosaurs. The PPDC is constantly conducting multiple studies to hopefully reveal more secrets from the Anteverse.\r\n\r\n#21 How do Jaegers stand in water?\r\nAs long as the Jaeger has a solid seabed to walk on, it can function upright in the sea. Most Jaegers are built to function fully submerged in water as well.\r\n\r\n#20 What is Kaiju blue?\r\nKaiju Blue is the potentially lethal condition that humans can develop from exposure to Kaiju blood. Because of this, Kaiju blood itself (or more specifically the toxic element within it) has also become synonymous with Kaiju Blue.\r\n\r\n#19 How much would it cost to build a Jaeger from Pacific Rim?\r\nDepending on the size, Mark, and armaments various Jaegers have been known to range in cost from approximately $80 billion USD to $105 billion USD.\r\n\r\n#15 Are Godzilla and Pacific Rim related?\r\nGodzilla and Pacific Rim do not take place in the same universe, but wouldn’t that be cool?\r\n\r\n#14 Was Godzilla a Kaiju?\r\nKaiju is defined as ‘strange beast’, so in that sense Godzilla is indeed a kaiju. However, the similarity to Pacific Rim’s Kaiju ends there.\r\n\r\n#10 How are Jaegers named?\r\nA Jaeger’s name is its official military call sign, decided by the PPDC Shatterdome where it is launched. The name is chosen to embody the power and personality of the Jaeger and acts as a symbol of hope for all it defends.\r\n\r\n#8 Why did the Kaiju want Newt? \r\nIn the first film, Newt drifted with a Kaiju brain, connecting his mind to the hive mind of the Precursors. When the Kaiju attacked Hong Kong, they were attracted to him like a moth to a flame.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\n\nStill haven’t subscribed to WIRED on YouTube? ►► http://wrd.cm/15fP7B7 \r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT WIRED\r\nWIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

The Semi can go a whopping 500 miles between charges, hauling 80,000 pounds along the way. And it can sorta, kinda drive itself—on highways, anyway. The truck comes with Enhanced Autopilot, the second generation of Tesla's semiautonomous technology, equipped with automatic braking, lane keeping, and lane departure warnings.\r\n\r\nAfter the Tesla CEO spent half an hour onstage extolling the virtues of his new electric 18-wheeler, he stepped away and the lights went out.

Turns out, that’s not the case at all. \r\n\r\nIn the real world—aka Upside Down-free 2017—their down-time activities are decidedly more conventional: texting, roasting their friends’ Instagram posts, filming their own antics. Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas Sinclair), for example, likes to look up old Jodeci videos on YouTube. But, because they’re famous, the Stranger Things gang also get to do some things not everyone gets the chance to do, like when Finn Wolfhard (Mike Wheeler) got to take a picture with Stan Lee.\r\n\r\nPhoto ops with comics legends are an outlier, though; most of the time the young denizens of Hawkins, Indiana are doing the same stuff on their phones as everyone else.
