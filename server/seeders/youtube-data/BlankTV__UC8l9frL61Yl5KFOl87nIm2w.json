As is 2015, Pirosaint is looking for an steady and capable singer to start booking shows in NY.\n\nAbout the Video: It's been a while since we have touched these tracks. We all went separate ways and these were recorded back then in 2015. Now, Gonzalo and I have been working our way to release them so this is a sample of what we had done. Please enjoy it. More of these are coming out soon.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.pirosaint.com\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/pirosaint\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/pirosaint\nMyspace: http://myspace.com/pirosaint\nReverbNation: http://reverbnation.com/pirosaint\nBandCamp: http://pirosaint.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/pirosaint\n\nLabel Name: Digmetalworld \nLabel Website: http://www.digmetalworld.com\n\nSong Lyrics:  \"Awaken My Conscience\"\n\nJust close your eyes, just leave the noise outside \nkeep it to you now that you have control \nif can’t do it you will lose it all \nyou live a life of a slave \nworking to death day after day \n\nwaking me up now \nwaking me up from up here \nsee my soul free flying on top, it feels alright \n\ndont need to tell you to what you do \nimages are all around me, disturbing truth \ni don’t think you understand \nlet it all go and try something new \n\nwaking me up now \nwaking me up from up here \nsee my soul free flying on top, it feels alright \n\nwaking me up now \nwaking me up from inside of their hearts \nsee the infected brutality, it feels alright \n\ndon't turn around \nno coming back \nawaken my conscience \ntime never stops \nand now its here big time will disappear \nnow its today my time of not to be afraid \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKvHgW-wXxw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKvHgW-wXxw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKvHgW-wXxw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKvHgW-wXxw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKvHgW-wXxw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"TKvHgW-wXxw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/_yGJfUhsktZEInAm69xJ43dOh6A\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnZkRHdZcVRGT1lV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-07-07T02:10:23.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Siks - \"Jumpin‘ Jack Flash\" MuSiKS - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Siks - \"Jumpin‘ Jack Flash\" - Like this video?

E in Italia, che almeno in questo cerca di non rimanere staccata dal resto del mondo, la scena hardcore melodica ha sempre mostrato segni di indubbia\nvitalità. Da Terni ce lo confermano i cinque ragazzi che compongono L’Alba Di Nuovo: cresciuti ascoltando i maestri Good Riddance, Strike Anywhere, Ignite e Rise Against,\ndecidono di formare la loro band nel 2007. Dopo pochi mesi i cinque musicisti registrano un promo di tre canzoni, accompagnato da una lunga serie di date che li porterà nei quattro anni successivi a calcare i palchi di tutta Italia e a suonare con le migliori band del panorama HC del nostro Paese. \nIl gruppo partecipa infine con il brano \"Ritrovare me stesso\" alla compilation prodotta dall’etichetta Indiebox.\nNel 2009 arriva finalmente il disco d’esordio intitolato “Naufrago”, prodotto in collaborazione con GB Sound (che ne segue anche il management) e B&BRecords. Il CD sarà distribuito in digitale da WynonaDigital e in Giappone dalla MilestonesSounds.\nSempre nello stesso anno la band fa il suo primo tour europeo che la porterà in Germania (con gli svedesi Misconduct), Francia, Olanda e Belgio assieme ai Lucchesi New Real Disaster. “Naufrago” è anche il titolo del singolo accompagnato da un bellissimo video realizzato in collaborazione con IgnorantProd e GB Sound, con la regia di Giuseppe Bruno. \nLa band vanta la partecipazione a numerose compilation europee e estere tra la quali una in Messico e una in Indonesia. \nIl 2012 è per la band un anno di cambiamenti: l’abbandono di David, il chitarrista, che lascia il posto a Francesco; a Gennaio, la registrazione de “LA NUOVA RAZZA” , nuovissimo Full Length, 11 tracce di puro Hardcore tra passione e rabbia. Registrato presso l’Hell Smell Studio di Roma, e mixato da Daniele Brian “Vanilla Sky” Autore, nel suo studio personale a Roma. \nIl disco sarà prodotto dalla Gb Sound Label, che segue la band fin dagli esordi, ed incollaborazione con S.D. records; distribuito in Europa da Crashsound e in USA daCDbaby.\nNegli ultimi anni la band ha lavorato al nuovo ep registrato e prodotto da Alessandro Beltrame presso lo Skull studio di Terni.\nNel 2017, a dieci anni dalla formazione della band, le ultime fatiche li portano sotto l’etichetta ligure “This is Core”, con la quale firmano un contratto che prevede l’uscita del nuovo lavoro a fine Novembre e un tour promozionale in tutta Italia.\nStay tuned.\n \nDirector Name: Giordano Torregiani\nProducer Name: L'Alba di Nuovo\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lalba.dinuovo\n \nLabel Name: This Is Core Records\nLabel Website: https://www.facebook.com/pg/thisiscoremusic/\n \nSong Lyrics: \"Come un Sasso\"\n\nUn'altra cena stanca la serata attenderà\nl'epilogo di una giornata sterile \ndi noi sempre impegnati ad incartarci l'anima \ncon il denaro e che probabilmente poi soffocherà \n\nUn sasso non può mai arginare un fiume \n\nE dietro a un vetro mentre guardo fuori un albero \ndi riflesso vedo gli occhi impalliditi \nda illlogiche realtà \n\nUn sasso non può mai arginare un fiume \n\nE penso a quello che io vorrei \nnon esserlo lo sai \n\nUn sasso non può mai arginare un fiume \n\nEterno istante \ndi uno sfuggevole ricordo che \nappagante mi riscalderà \nprima di tornare \na contraddire l'esistenza mia \nma non del tutto a soccombere \n\nMa è un dato Certo che \ni sogni non li possono perquisire mai \n\nEterno istante \ndi uno sfuggevole ricordo che \nappagante mi riscalderà \nprima di tornare \na contraddire l'esistenza mia \nma non del tutto a soccombere\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VnuGpMT4m-s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VnuGpMT4m-s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VnuGpMT4m-s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VnuGpMT4m-s/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VnuGpMT4m-s/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":13,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"VnuGpMT4m-s"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/bYXohS0OmGhhnxrkPdM1d7FLjJ4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm9ITld2VUxCQTJ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-26T07:30:00.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Guardians - \"Lies\" Official Music Video - A BlankTV Feature!","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Guardians - \"Lies\" - Like this video?

Despite the preference for heavy sounds Nico has always strongly stated \"You can intersect any kind of sounds between themselves, create any kind of virtuosity, but it's the melody that must prevail, without compromises.\"In 2015 they released their debut album 'Stay Human', a phrase that became famous by the activist, journalist and Italian writer Vittorio Arrigoni.\nIt consists of eleven songs and is the reflection (this is how they love to define themselves) of what the Italian band wants to transmit: a concentration of power, melody and soul.The visual impact is also great, that from immediately, they have tried to transmit in both their live performances and in their music videos .\nIn 2017 the second album came out, 'Mankind',  a more mature and personal album.And when someone asks them \"What kind of music do you do?\",  Soulspirya reply, \"We just make music ... you decide!\".\nAnd the classic question that is made to every band, \"Where does your band name come from?\", They reply: \"The help was given to us by one of our faithful companions “Vinum” ... but maybe that day, we had a glass too many\" \n\nDirector Name: NICO\nProducer Name: SOULSPIRYA\n\nArtist Website: http://www.soulspirya.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/soulspirya\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/soulspirya\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/soulspirya\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Everything\"   \n     \nYou can write   \nyou can play   \nyou can think   \neverything   \nyou can eat   \nyou can drink   \nyou can feel   \neverything   \n \n \nEverything     \nat your feet, your lips   \nif you want     \nEverything     \nin your hands your head   \nyou can get     \n \n \nYou can say  \nyou can make \nyou can draw \neverything  \nyou can see  \nyou can find  \nyou can cry  \neverything  \n \n \nEverything    \nat your feet, your lips    \nif you want     \nEverything     \nin your hands your head   \nyou can get     \n  \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sirU0VaIqF4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sirU0VaIqF4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sirU0VaIqF4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sirU0VaIqF4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sirU0VaIqF4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":17,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sirU0VaIqF4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/JDTtPnoiBZsqW4_rE81kSMNgt9A\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lmp1LThxd3RKNnAw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-28T23:06:39.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Dirty Work - \"Hogtown Hooligans\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Dirty Work - \"Hogtown Hooligans\" - Like this video?

His daddy was a trucker. He was a real fuckin' crazy stupid motherfucker. He liked to push his luck to try to make a buck cause he liked to get high. Jenny was a girl who liked to poke her veins. if she didn't get her way she'd kinda go insane. The alley\"s where she fucked, that 's how she made a buck cause she liked to get high. Bobby was a boy who almost finished school when he started cooking shit. he thought it would be cool. Til chemicals ignited and burned his ass alive cause he liked to get high. Have you tried it? You know you'd like it. Well, there's a power trippin' cop cruisin' down the block. If you give him what he craves he'll look the other way. When he fell from grace they shot him in the face cause he liked to get high. She's a rich college hottie who always liked to party. when she hit the floor dead she bumped her little head. Got the Vivatrol heart but couldn't make it start cause she liked to get high. Have you tried it? You know you'd like it.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ur34pd7z5WU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ur34pd7z5WU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ur34pd7z5WU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ur34pd7z5WU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ur34pd7z5WU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":35,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Ur34pd7z5WU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/FjkRH22zh2uggwIZJTD1J61R9uM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjBtcXdOTDdIaURz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-22T21:26:37.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Witch - \"Ignite the Dark Matter\" M&O Music - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Witch - \"Ignite the Dark Matter\" - Like this video?

The band were joined by bassist Devid Dell’Aiera from northern Italy who would complete the line-up. Their sound draws from a range of influences including rock, blues and Britpop, with spectators likening their sound to that of the Arctic Monkeys and Catfish and the Bottlemen.\nIn 2012, Taxi Joe supported Fleetwood Mac’s Peter Green on his UK tour which lead them to open for Labrynth at London’s O2 Arena. The band continue to showcase their sound with shows in the UK and Italy, most recently performing a special one-off unplugged performance in New York City. In 2018, the band opened the first Camden Rocks festival show in London as well as playing the final date of the NambucaPalooza festival. Taxi Joe returned to the London O2 Arena to play the Stone Free Festival along with rock headliners Scorpions and Megadeth. With a number of singles on Spotify and iTunes, the lads continue to discipline themselves as explosive performers and a fierce writing team, at the same time, self-producing their own music videos for their official YouTube channel.\n\nDirector Name: Aaron Truss\nProducer Name: Taxi Joe\n\nAbout the Video: Comedy music video, parodying dating videos from the 1980’s.\n\nArtist Website: www.taxijoe.co.uk\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/taxijoeuk\nTwitter: @taxijoeuk\nMyspace: Really?\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/taxijoeuk\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/taxijoeuk\n\nLabel Name: Sheare Records\nLabel Website: http://www.taxijoe.co.uk\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-2zUnTBK-Y4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-2zUnTBK-Y4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-2zUnTBK-Y4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-2zUnTBK-Y4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-2zUnTBK-Y4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":37,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-2zUnTBK-Y4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/r9dFp8fVPyVcUF1ENtRXafahVgE\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlRvd0h2T0tnX2ZF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-22T21:16:56.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Sons of Alpha Centauri - \"Io\" H42 Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Sons of Alpha Centauri - \"Io\" - Like this video?

The album, set for released on 1 June 2018 through H42 Records, has been ten years in the making.\n\n'Continuum' is wrought with dark anthems and intense textures, introspective interludes with tidal waves of distortion. It is awash with soaring melodies and a deep underpinning of the darker side of light. The second album has been a long time coming for the UK quartet who, having reflected upon their collaborations with Karma to Burn and Yawning Man, had initially looked to record their sophomore album back in 2009.\n\n“The band carries a duality,” bassist Nick Hannon says. “This was reflected in the debut which carried two distinct tones, one dark and one light. We were going to record an album in 2009, but that record went onto become the Yawning Sons debut so instead we worked on a much darker reflection of the band for the second album.”\n\nThis darker reflection needed to interface seamlessly as both a dedicated chapter continuing on from the debut and as a musical milestone in its own right. In order to do this the band approached Aaron Harris of the legendary and phenomenally influential post metal titans ISIS to produce, mix and engineer the album.\n\n“We had been in contact with the ISIS guys since 2005,” Hannon says, “When they went their separate ways and Harris wrote and produced the debut Palms album we knew that he was our guy.” Harris accepted and over the course of two years the sessions were brought together.\n\n“Working with Aaron has made this album an intense composition,” King explains, “Aaron only produced two records over the past few years and he puts everything into it, he got the best out of the band, and together we made a record we are exceptionally proud of”.\n\nProducer Name: Sons of Alpha Centauri\nArtist Website: http://www.sonsofalphacentauri.co.uk \nFacebook: https://en-gb.facebook.com/sonsofalphacentauri/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/soalphacentauri?lang=en \nBandCamp: https://sonsofalphacentauri.bandcamp.com \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sonsofalphacentauri/?hl=en \n\nLabel Name: H42 Records\nLabel Website: https://www.h42records.com\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TowHvOKg_fE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TowHvOKg_fE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TowHvOKg_fE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TowHvOKg_fE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TowHvOKg_fE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":38,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"TowHvOKg_fE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ZAQIn8CJ3y4IK00FuLbzhVSGA9M\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkJOdFk1NmlzNWM0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-18T03:02:53.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Dorks - \"I'd Rather Be a Dork\" On the House Music - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Dorks - \"I'd Rather Be a Dork\"  - Like this video?

In September 2016 they went to Pressure Drop Studios in Stockport and recorded their single \"Mr. Big Shot\" with Will Farley (Stay Clean Jolene / The Leif Ericsson) which was released through Horn & Hoof Records.

This is a song about that first domino to fall, that first seemingly innocuous choice to risk everything for a quick fix of something that feels good, a ‘minute on fire’ that rapidly ends up sending your whole life up in flames. \n\n“This is how the story of RedHook begins,” she continues. “With a descent into corruption.” \n\nDirector Name: Keith Bogan\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/weareredhook\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/weareredhook\nBandCamp: https://weareredhook.bandcamp.com/releases\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/weareredhook\n\nLyrics: \"Minute on Fire\"\n\nThere is a shadow that hides in the walls\nIt’s there everyday waiting to strangle us all\nYou might not see it coming, in fact you usually won’t \nAnd you hope that it’ll unwrap its hands from your throat\n\nSometimes the days just drift away\nSometimes it’s hard to see the way\nThrough all the noise, through all the waste…\nAnd that’s the way we burn\n\nWake up\nI’m burning alive\nCause it’s like a killing desire\nSo messed up\nYou’d trade your whole life\nFor a fucking minute on fire\n\nThere’s a black cat staring back at me\nEvery time I look outside\nI don’t know his agenda but I tend to be reminded of mistakes I’ve made they play on a loop\nIn my mind\nBut what business does an animal without a soul have to concern itself with mine?\n\nSometimes the days just drift away\nSometimes it’s hard to see the way\nAnd I know I could save today or go insane today, I guess I’ll never learn\nAnd when I try a voice inside’s always screaming “Fuck it, watch me burn!”\n\nWake up\nI’m burning alive\nCause it’s like a killing desire\nSo messed up\nYou’d trade your whole life\nFor a fucking minute on fire\n\nYou’ll never know\nYou’ll never know\nHow far you’ll go\nUntil you’re right on the verge and end up cutting the wire\nFor a minute on fire.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Ch6HqDX5_A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Ch6HqDX5_A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Ch6HqDX5_A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Ch6HqDX5_A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Ch6HqDX5_A/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":41,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"0Ch6HqDX5_A"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/jQGIF_LfoYuRj-xqyLIzdYfU5P4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnBXTTNMOU5TLUw4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-20T21:22:12.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Cerber - \"Haka\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Cerber - \"Haka\" - Like this video?

CERBER's concert is a rotten ritual of a maniacal dance. An experience unlike any other.\n \nCERBER's music is a blend of hardcore smartness, heavy and muddy sludge metal with a heavy melodic presence or it's complete lack. Unconventional compositions, lyrics and utterly different combinations of familiar components are CERBER's black banner.\nMorbid spall of void which we proudly carry through the ashes of an ardent world.\n \nThey are as follows:\n \nDemo 'Z prochu' 2011\nEP 'Mad at the Soul' 2012\nEP 'Mammothian' 2012\nLP 'Lust for Suffering' 2015\nLP 'Śmiara' 2018\n \nCERBER is\nWiśnia - guitar, voice\nSmoluch - drums\nAlex - bass, second voice\n \nDirector Name:  Michał Piłat\nProducer Name:  Michał Piłat\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/cerberband\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/CerberHardcore\nReverbNation:  https://www.reverbnation.com/cerber7\nBandCamp:  https://cerber.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cerberszmato/\n \nSong Lyrics: \"Haka\"\n \ndzisiaj spłynie stara krew \nmądre diabła córy usłyszą zew ponury \nzlecą się jak szczury \n \ntwój wyrok to ręce związane na supeł \n \nna rogach jelenia \nw potwarzy istnienia \nzłorzeczę do lustra \ni staję w płomieniach \n \nka-mate, ka-mate \nka-ora, ka-ora \n \nw bystrej rzece \ntoni śmiałej jak pierwszy wrzask \nnie chcę zaistnieć \nw czerni i bieli \n \nskąpanym w słońcu korytem \npopłynie moja kipiel\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pWM3L9NS-L8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pWM3L9NS-L8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pWM3L9NS-L8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pWM3L9NS-L8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pWM3L9NS-L8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":42,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pWM3L9NS-L8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/6IOPNXeMJg98kyH2JOBT0Y1pAb8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk8za19xV0NKUXhn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-18T21:34:07.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Luicé - \"The Secret\" Thor's Kitchen Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Luicé - \"The Secret\" - Like this video?

Meeting in Stockholm in 2017, this Australian/Swedish pair have quickly built a strong live reputation for mixing catchy indie-pop with darker themes and arrangements, led by the enigmatic Therese Karlsson. \"New Century\" was recorded in Los Angeles and Stockholm with Daniel Rejmer (Ben Frost, Foals, Girls Names) and extends on the more melodic moments from their previous work with bands such as Fire to the Stars and Mid-State Orange.\n \nAfter relocating to Stockholm from Melbourne in 2016, Therese and Tim came together via some rather fortunate semi-random sampling (i.e. internet band forum) and quickly realised that where Tim was good at starting songs, Therese excelled at finishing them. Their single \"New Century\" describes the tension many experience between unfulfilled desire and resigning to one’s fate with a drive to take control of one’s destiny and make a difference. The title, \"New Century\" is meant to suggest reinvention, a personal reinvention – which whilst desirable is not always an easy or straightforward thing to do.\n \nAccompanying the single is award winning directors Kyle V James & Mallori Taylor’s incredible video, short entirely on a 360-degree camera (https://youtu.be/CUWj7mmRmjY). The video extends on the lyrical theme of reinvention, using the 360-degree camera to distort or reimagine a range of natural and urban landscapes into dream-like exaggerations of their original selves: oceans turn to globes, whole forests morph into a single dandelion as a metaphor for the internal personal changes the song’s main protagonist so desires, but can’t quite seem to obtain. By pairing the music with such wild distortions of the everyday objects and landscapes the viewer is encouraged to look at their own everyday life in a different light and from a different angle – the truth may be right there in front of you, you just need to be more flexible with your interpretation.\n\nDirector Name:  Kyle V James & Mallori Taylor\nProducer Name:  Kyle V James & Mallori Taylor \n\nAbout the Video: Shot entirely on a 360 degree out and around Milwaukee.\n\nArtist Website:  https://soundcloud.com/tinyfighter\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/tinyfighterz/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TinyFighterz\nBandCamp: https://tinyfighterz.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tinyfighterz\n\nLabel Name:  The A&R Department\nLabel Website: http://www.theaandrdepartment.com/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"New Century\"\n\n(Words & music by Tim Spelman & Therese Karlsson)\n \nQuicksand, you standing still\nSame track, I am tired listening \nYou better move on \nStop feel sorry for yourself\nWatching, watching the screen\nSeeing someone else living your dream \nWhile your hiding in your loneliness \n \nFeel desire inside its burning \nToo afraid to see things turning \nStuck in a middle where you don’t want to be \nFeel the same way over and over\nFeels like you can’t move forward \ntoo afraid to be what you know you can be \n \nToo much, too much lonely time \nMake you crazy turn your mind from reality into fantasy\nStop waste your time \nRise up, rise up from the ground \nI said hold up hold your head up high \nYou better see you got to feel free\n \nFeel desire inside its burning \nToo afraid to see things turning \nStuck in a middle where you don’t want to be \nFeel the same way over and over\nFeels like you can’t move forward \nToo afraid to be what you know you can be \n \nIf you never try you never know \nYou never try, you never know\nRise up, rise up from the ground\nI said hold up, hold your head up high \nYou better see you got to feel free\n \nFeel desire inside its burning \nToo afraid to see things turning \nStuck in a middle where you don’t want to be \nAnd you feel the same way over and over\nFeels like you can’t move forward \nToo afraid to be what you know you can be \n \nIf you never try, you never know \nYou never try, you never know\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nZkE9L4KFY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nZkE9L4KFY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nZkE9L4KFY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nZkE9L4KFY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nZkE9L4KFY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":51,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4nZkE9L4KFY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/mnBrUb7OYKo8gh3ycZEr17XBTqk\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnZuUTlxenFCeXBv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-15T23:00:09.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Funeral Parade - \"3 Temps\" M&O Music - Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Funeral Parade - \"3 Temps\" - Like this video?

The band's style can be described as a mix of heavy and recognizable riffing, groovy drumming beats, analogue synth sounds, and melodic expressive vocals. Even though band members used to call their style alternative rock, some music journalists describe it as “combination of metal and rock genres”, and some songs they define as nu-metal. With the release of the 'Black Sails' album the band have defined themselves as 'alternative post-metal'.\n\nDirector Name: Pavel Ignatovich\nDirector Link: https://www.facebook.com/pavel.ign\n \nAbout the Video: Hi all!

During the years they noticed that the hardcore they loved, almost disappeared from the scene. Everything was getting darker and more evil. There was only one thing left to do and that is to form a new band and bring the punk back into hardcore. \nSoon after Superhero Status formed, the guys released a demo and started hitting the stages all over Holland, Belgium and Germany. A lot of shows were played and the band opened up for bands like H2O, Expire and Comeback kid to name a few. In 2016 Superhero Status first official release was the self-titled 7” on WTF Records. The good reviews made the band hungry for more, so early 2018 they went to the studio to record the follow up EP called “Leave the herd”. As the title suggest the band is still trying to break free from the modern main stream hardcore genre. \nWatch out for some hardcore tunes with a touch of melody!\n\nDirector Name: Ray B\nProducer Name: Ray B\n\nAbout the Video: DIY no budget\n\nArtist Website: http://www.superherostatus.nl/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SuperherostatusHC/\nContact: superherostatus@aalst-waalre.nl\n\nLabel Name: WTF Records\nLabel Website: https://wtfrecords.eu/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9B_44CGbIM0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9B_44CGbIM0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9B_44CGbIM0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9B_44CGbIM0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9B_44CGbIM0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":59,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9B_44CGbIM0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/z72_pg8PWKrWXW6HN1RWmnEZssY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlZUSVViaFlkX0xv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-15T02:47:19.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Rotten Stitches - \"Punching Through Mirrors\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Rotten Stitches - \"Punching Through Mirrors\" - Like this video?

The band has undergone two reformations since its start, and transitioned from a trio to a quintet. Although its roots are deep in punk soil, the band draws influences from numerous sources in genres such as alternative, metal, and popular rock, which is ironic considering its name. The band's sound - one that seeks to inspire creativity and invoke emotions - has been described as being both unique and familiar at the same time. Under Influenced is proud to create music that encourages people to stand up for their beliefs, be themselves, and avoid being negatively influenced by others. The members of Under Influenced enjoy activities such as skiing, online gaming, airsoft, wiffle ball, swimming, baseball, building forts, and playing music.\n \nAbout the Video: The first lyric video for Under Influenced featuring the single \"Disguises\" from their latest album, 'These Days Are Darker Than I Remember'. Special thanks go out to Dan Perez for the video production, RenO for the album artwork and new logos, and Cherry Pit Studios for the music production.\n \nProducer Name: Dan Perez\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/underinfluencedofficial\nMyspace: https://myspace.com/underinfluenced\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/underinfluenced\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipda64AW1jfRtnJ6qDyJ-Q?view_as=subscriber\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/underinfluenced\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/underinfluenced\nPureVolume: http://www.purevolume.com/UnderInfluenced\n \nSong Lyrics: \"Disguises\"\n\nWhoa.\nHidden behind anxious feelings, beauty lies and yearns to love like everyone else does.\nUnderstanding is hard to come by these days, don’t be afraid, don’t be ashamed, my love.\nLost and found, yet your disguise has made a fool of me.\nRun away with me, my dear.

Two years after the release of their third album, 'Memories of an Invisible Pistol' (2016), celebrated by the critics, and with their name shortened to a more manageable format, the Sevillian band unveiled \"Padrino Buffalo 1\", the first of three EPs that will be appearing throughout 2018 and 2019. \n\nComposed during the summer of 2017 in the band's own studios, and mixed between February and March with the help of Fernand Zambruno, the five songs that make up this first album share an obsession with making people dance. An obsession that has led Casas and La Pistola to abandon their usual sixties manners in order to embrace a neat and muscular dance-punk, in which the melodies continue to shine with a new wave aftertaste and the sound looks sideways at the post-punk eighties. \n\n\nDirector Name:  Jose Casas\nProducer Name:  Jose Casas\n\nAbout the Video: Official video clip of the song \"Baile del Optalidón\" Made by Jose Casas with the collective Despeinados\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/CasasylaPistola/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/Lapistoladepapa\nBandCamp:  https://josecasasylapistoladepapa.bandcamp.com/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/casasylapistola/\n\nLabel Name:  Stiffsur (self-published)\nLabel Website:  https://www.facebook.com/Stiffsur/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Baile del Optalidon\" \n\nHe mirado a los pájaros\nhe sentido la envidia\nescondido y con química\nme sostengo en el aire\nen el baile del optalidón\n\nFui buscando en mercados de inviernos\nencontré una novelista de twiter\nera triste y jugaba al despiste\nsometida al baile del optalidón\n\nSalgo por el disparadero\npero no llego muy lejos\naunque me falta el pellejo\nnunca llego a perro viejo\n\nHabitaciones vacías\ny la cabeza llena de sustos\nhabía un niño paseando un disgusto\ny un soldado soñando que desertará\n\nSalgo por el disparadero\npero no llego muy lejos\naunque me falta el pellejo\nnunca llego a perro viejo\n\nPerro de quién, perro de nadie\nPerro de quién, perro de nadie\n\nTraducction:\nI've looked at the birds. \nI've been jealous \nhidden and with chemistry \nI hold myself in the air \nat the opalidon dance. \n\nI went looking at winter markets \nI found a twitter novelist \nI was sad and I was playing dumb. \nsubject to the dance of the optalidon \n\nI'm coming out the door \nbut I'm not getting very far. \nalthough I'm missing the skin \nI never get to be an old dog. \n\nEmpty rooms \nand a head full of scares \nthere was a boy walking around in disgust \nand a soldier dreaming he'll desert \n\nI'm coming out the door \nbut I'm not getting very far. \nalthough I'm missing the skin \nI never get to be an old dog. \n\nWhose dog, nobody's dog \nWhose dog, nobody's dog\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6sErYjmI_bc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6sErYjmI_bc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6sErYjmI_bc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6sErYjmI_bc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6sErYjmI_bc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":64,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6sErYjmI_bc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ounkMqks35OV8m17_cIZAQcgVrM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlhoTUZFT0dNSVc0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-14T19:18:16.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Remy Baggins - \"Come Thru\" Thirsty Worldwide - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Remy Baggins - \"Come Thru\" - Like this video?

It's her broadest, boldest album to date, with songs that anchor themselves in southern storytelling and Jonas’s smooth, unforced croon. Written and recorded in her hometown of Fredericksburg, Virginia, Butter is a retro-minded album for the modern age — the sound of a songwriter celebrating her circumstances.\n\nButter was tracked at Wally Cleaver's Recording Studio, within a five-minute drive of Karen's home. She'd head over to the studio after putting her kids to bed. Tim Bray, her guitarist and musical partner for nearly half a decade, joined her for those nighttime recording sessions, as did a number of other musicians who laced Butter's ten songs with pedal steel, B3 organ, upright piano, layers of guitar, and vintage-sounding, seven-piece horn arrangements. \nAs the album came together, each song took on a life of its own. The title track is a late-night, big-band jazz number, while \"My Sweet Arsonist\" is a woozy, slow- burning love ballad. \"Gospel of the Road\" and \"Yellow Brick Road\" both nod to Tom Petty's influence, thanks to ringing guitars and heartland rock & roll melodies. \"Dance With Me\" slows down its tempo to a swinging waltz, while the Beatles-esque \"Mr. Wonka\" speeds it back up to a surreal circus’s pace. Together, Butter's songs explore one woman's story to the tune of a full range of American roots music.\nThere's perhaps no better summary of the album's peppy punch than its flagship song, \"Butter,\" which kicks off with honking trumpets, swooning vocals, and slyly witty lyrics. The song tells the story of a hardworking mother who's a killer cook and a first-rate parent. She’s sexy, ambitious, composed, and sipping straight whiskey just before 5 o’clock. \n\nStop on by for dinner and try it, don’t you wanna? / You’re gonna love her / Mama cooks with butter \n\n\"Butter\" is Karen Jonas’s finest combination of melody and message to date, stripped free of artificial ingredients and fillers. This is \"Butter\" — smooth one minute, decadent the next, and fulfilling throughout.\n\nDirector Name: Ryan Poe\n\nArtist Website: http://www.karenjonasmusic.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/karenjonasmusic\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/karenjonasmusic\nBandCamp: https://karenjonasmusic.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/karenjonasmusic\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Butter\"\n\nMama cooks with butter \nof course she does sugar \nsoft and warm right on the counter\nShe looks like Grace Kelly\nshe tastes like Betty Crocker \nMama cooks with butter \n\nMama cooks with butter\nyou know the real thing\ndon't give me no Country Crock or margarine\nDinner rolls on the table\ncookies in the cupboard \nMama cooks with butter \n\nMama drinks straight whiskey \nof course she does baby \nstanding in the kitchen at 4:53\nShe keeps up with the Joneses\nshe reads good housekeeping \nMama drinks straight whiskey \n\nMama drinks straight whiskey\nshe's the real thing \nthough she makes a fine manhattan or a martini\nShe is ambitious\nshe believes in efficiency \nMama drinks straight whiskey \n\nShe feels like Elizabeth Taylor\nwhen she slips off her big diamond ring\nMama’s here to listen when you wanna talk\nbut when she feeds you boy you know you better eat\n\nMama cooks with butter\nyou know the real thing\nshe still likes her shag carpets and wood paneling \nShe turns on Dean Martin\nshe turns on Frank Sinatra \nMama cooks with butter \nStop on by for dinner \ntry it don’t you wanna\nyou’re gonna love her\nMama cooks with butter\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ClZgwbDwJu8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ClZgwbDwJu8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ClZgwbDwJu8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ClZgwbDwJu8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ClZgwbDwJu8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":66,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ClZgwbDwJu8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/0eCm6Y3V_J7s3YuiF0800SBrG1o\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjNpU2p6SmpVNEQ4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-14T18:49:27.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Erevan - \"Lies\" M&O Music - Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Erevan - \"Lies\" - Like this video?

Then, Florian Herpe (vocals/guitar) and Lolly C. (bass/vocals) performed during a time in duo like The Kills, before being joined by Bruno Gadiot on drums.\nPariadelux released its first album \"Topsy-Turvy\" on the label M&O Music in 2018. Its title translates all the ambivalence shadow/light that we find from the start in the name of the band. Pariadelux continues its initiatory quest between chaos and rebirth, through titles that bathe the listener in a grungy-stoner distortion, through powerful heavy rock compositions that never deny emotion. The production is by Francis Caste, responsible for the sound of Bukowsky, Hangman's chair, Seven Weeks…\nAbout the lyrics, the album invites to introspection, to explore the darkness of the psyche towards the light of consciousness; as evoked by its visual of the octopus queen of the depths and the snake capable of moulting. The subjects of the lyrics: self-destruction (Fuhrer on my Shoulder), to reborn from the ashes (Is This Love), to change the coal into diamond (Diamonds), to expand our consciousness (On Fire), to seek enlightenment (In The Rodeo).\n\nDirector Name: Antoine Basler\nProducer Name: Black Louve Production\n\nArtist Website: http://www.pariadelux.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pariadelux\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pariadelux\nBandCamp: https://pariadelux.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pariadelux/  \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/4ww9VCz25THFNlHpiyhWvC\n\nLabel Name: M & O Music\nLabel Website: http://www.m-o-music.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"On Fire\"\n\nWe look for something outside        \nTo fill the nothing inside    \nLike the dummies that we are    \nThings aren’t what they seem        \nWe’re stuck on the God screen    \nCross my heart and hope to die    \n\nWe poison the ocean        \nConsuming’s our obsession    \nLike the zombies that we are    \nChimeras completeness    \nCover us in darkness    \nCross my heart and hope to die    \n\nWe‘re on the move    \nWho let us down ?    \nSo sick sick sick    \nJust look around    \nWe set the world on fire    \nSet the world on fire\nSet the world on fire\nOn fire, on fire    \n\nWhen the light is filled with gloom    \nWe’ll settle down on the moon    \nLike the pilgrims that we are    \nTomorrow is doomsday        \nNobody will hear us pray    \nCross my heart and hope to die    \n\nWe‘re on the move    \nWho let us down ?    \nSo sick sick sick    \nJust look around    \nWe set the world on fire    \nSet the world on fire\nSet the world on fire\nOn fire, on fire\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a6_ED2ejAwY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a6_ED2ejAwY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a6_ED2ejAwY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a6_ED2ejAwY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a6_ED2ejAwY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":69,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"a6_ED2ejAwY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/cKbUq1-K7nskKhN0HP96BOhF1x0\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm9oaF9KU0pxM2VJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-13T19:03:51.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Michael McDermott - \"Knocked Down\" Pauper Sky Records","description":"http://www.HankTV.com - Michael McDermott - \"Knocked Down\" - Like this video?

I knew I had to stop, but it took a while for me to get the message.” He credits his wife and their young daughter, Rain, for finally pulling him through.\n \nMcDermott’s 11th studio recording, 'Out from Under', due for release April 27 on Pauper Sky Records. The poignant new album sees him riding the crest of a critical and commercial upswing following the unprecedented success of his previous effort, 2016’s 'Willow Springs', which reached No. 1 on EuroAmericana charts. But 'Out from Under' is more than a victory lap: brimming with richly autobiographical songs that mix stunning frankness with wicked, idiosyncratic humor, it’s the sound of a clear-eyed, dedicated artist, now a contented husband and father, giving in to his heart’s most urgent commands and trusting his instincts in ways he never thought possible.\n\nDirector Name: Fred Uhter\n\nArtist Website: http://www.Michael-McDermott.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MichaelMcDermottMusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/michaelmcdermot\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/michaelmcdermott\n\nLabel Name: Pauper Sky Records\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Knocked Down\"\n\nIt’s always been like this\nNothing’s changed\nSince the day I was born\nI always felt a little strange\nI always did\nI always do\nSometimes I get a little lonely baby\nHow ‘bout you?\nI always doI always did\nYou better be careful When you're messin' with the kid It ain't no big thing It’s all the same to me Sometimes a little leak of light Is all you needIn these hard times You gotta take a few I ain't no glass jaw joker Baby that is true You can see the stars better from the underground I know a thing or two about being knocked down I lived like a dog Slept in the street I had a home in the bushes With the rats at my feet I've been so strung out In dirty hotel rooms Had girls on the pipe All afternoon I've been ridden like a horse All night and day Been turned out and burned out Led astray That's the way it is I'm tellin' you straight I gotta pocket full of rocket and I'm looking for a hard eight I'm a skid row savior, spike for a crown I know a thing or two about being knocked down I know a thing or two about being knocked down I got this old guitar An Irish hat Spent 20 years baby With a monkey on my back That was hard time Even harder still If the left one don't get you Then the right one will I've been hustled and muscled Left for dead Had my face to the wall And a gun to my head I've been cheated, defeated Played for a fool Everything I ever needed Always came from you I think it’s time we order, another round I know a thing or two about being knocked down Two days of riding shotgun in a Yellow Cab Started talking to a Priest right outside a Meth Lab I did not say, what I was trying to do I said \"Hell is arbitrary, it’s a point of view\"I think he got it, I think he understood I'm pretty sure he knew That I was up to no good Then I gave him a hug Went right in Sometimes you find heaven In a place of sin Hallelujah, Boy it’s never enough That which doesn't kill you man It makes you tough Then I'm the toughest thing goin' baby, pound for pound I know a thing or two about being knocked down I could hear the voices callin' from the corner men Tellin' me to stay down, that we had reached the end I thought, \" Fuck that...\" Nobody's callin this fight I'll decide when, There's still time to make it right It’s your life You get only one So you'd better beware of what you let it become I'm telling you straight, telling you true Do you choose your life or do you let it choose you?I said, I know a thing or two Yeah I know a thing or two about being knocked down\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohh_JSJq3eI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohh_JSJq3eI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohh_JSJq3eI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohh_JSJq3eI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohh_JSJq3eI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":70,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ohh_JSJq3eI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/DAwgrQPHAz_Iddk_Rnzjrg_BDZM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnRDMnBlRzJKRXJn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-13T18:53:23.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Tenderhooks - \"Yolena\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Tenderhooks - \"Yolena\" - Like this video?

The Beat Seekers sound like a lot of things but like nothing else all at the same time. With influences ranging from British invasion bands such as The Kinks, The Who, and The Beatles to riff rockers like Thin Lizzy, Motorhead, and early Metallica yet also bearing similarities to bands like The Ramones, The Replacements, The Stooges, Damned, and many more, The Beat Seekers are a force to be reckoned with coming from a place that is honest, from the gut, and unapologetically rock n' roll in an era where most rock acts are playing the same watered down formulated dribble. \n Formed in 2009, The Beat Seekers have been plagued with adversity but that hasn't stopped Keith Fertwagner from pumping out good music, even if it hasn't reached the audience it deserves. With the lineup now complete, the force is unstoppable. The full-on on intensity that bassist Earl Skow and drummer A.J. Bishop put out combined with the laid back cool of guitarist Brennan Moran are the perfect compliment to Keith's heartfelt delivery and kinetic energy that seems to win over any crowd that they play in front of. \n In these troubled times The Beat Seekers provide a soundtrack to our lives with politically driven songs that speak our truth and our desperate need for change.\n\nDirector Name: Keith Fertwagner\nProducer Name: Keith Fertwagner\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thebeatseekers\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/thebeatseekers\nBandCamp: https://thebeatseekers.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/the_beat_seekers\n\nLabel Name: Beat Seeker Records\n\nSong Lyrics: \"World Go 'Round and Breakdown\"\n\nWe don't talk so much, it seems we're growing out of touch, waste of useless memory, buried in by technology. We don't feel so much, the medication is the crutch, chained to our hypocrisy, making our own worst enemy...We watch the world go 'round n' breakdown, baby watch the world go 'round n' breakdown....Lines in the dust, feels like there's nothing I can trust, I say FUCK THE WORLD, my degeneration, FUCK THE WORLD, my degeneration, FUCK THE WORLD, no reconciliation, up to the minute and we're in it alone!\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdxkREafNvc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdxkREafNvc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdxkREafNvc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdxkREafNvc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdxkREafNvc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":72,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pdxkREafNvc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/t7TIiEXS5x92ZpfKyWJnesvRStw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkV2RGhuNnM5N05r","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-13T02:39:44.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Eliot Ash - \"One Step Away from Madness\" MadMan!

Records - Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: London, England, UK\n\nArtist Biography: London-based singer-songwriter Eliot Ash creates a unique blend of acoustic rock chords coupled with fast flowing vocals. His honest lyrics stick a middle finger up to today's society. With gigs across his hometown in venues such as Nambucca, The Monarch and The Half Moon, this rising star is already gathering quite a following.\nEliot released his debut single 'We Always Sail at Night' through MadMan Records in late 2017. It received wide coverage being played on Radio Stations such as RKC, FreshNet and 365. His follow up single ’Weak’ showed a darker side to his music and fans eagerly anticipated the release of his double EP ‘One Step Away from Madness'.\nEliot dropped the first part of his debut EP ‘One Step Away’ on the 23rd February 2018 and begun working with HotVox, BlankTV and BBC Introducing. \n'It’s a big shame that we would never be allowed to play “It’s the Weekend” on BBC Radio in its present form, but fair play to Eliot for not playing the corporate game. Anyway the out and out swearing is a big part of what makes the song so liberating. Sleaford Mods built up their credibility and cult following for years by genuinely not giving a fuck about whether anyone played them on the radio.' - Tom Robinson BBC Introducing.\nPart 2 ‘From Madness’ was released on 6th April 2018. With commercial tunes like ‘The Man Who Lived Life Through a Lens’and the pop punk infused ‘One Step Away from Madness’ getting radio play on BBC Introducing Tracks of The Week Playlist, Eliot Ash is certainly proving he’s more than ‘Just Another Kid Who Knows 4 Chords, Middle Class Cheek Whose Brain Got Bored’.\n\nDirector Name: Jay Maidment\nProducer Name: MadMan! Records\n\nAbout the Video: Hey guys, here is the official music video for the title track and closing song of my double EP 'One Step Away from Madness'. Thank you all for your amazing support, to James Mason, Jim Sole, Josh Wills and Island Farm Studio in helping me put this whole thing together and to everyone whose come out to the 50+ shows I've played over London this past year. I couldn't do it without you. I'm now taking this EP on the road with gigs across the country so stay tuned for further announcements. Much love :) \n\nArtist Website: http://www.eliot-ash.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/EliotAshMusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/EliotAshMusic\nMyspace: https://myspace.com/eliot.ash\nBandCamp: https://eliotash.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/eliotashmusic\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4tmAcG4cZw8tn24PO3pIdD\n\nLabel Name: MadMan!

Sharing a passion for not only metal, but music itself, TYRANT truly came into fruition with their release of their 'Jaws of Agony' demo in February of 2012. TYRANT's live shows include metal that ranges greatly from speedy solos to dark and ominous breakdowns. In 2013, TYRANT participated in numerous shows for the first half of the year but spent the remainder of the year writing and rehearsing material for their August 2014 release the ‘Purge EP’. TYRANT's 'Purge' EP has been streamed on radio stations such as Powerton Radio, Violent Forces Radio and HeadBangers FM. The power trio spent 2015 touring heavily around the region, to great responses at venues such as The Music Factory, The Intersection, The Loft, The Foundry, and The Token Lounge, performing alongside of Battlecross, Deicide, Metal Church and Havok to name a few. While they toured the surrounding area they took inspiration from strange life events and composed material for their most recent CD 'Black Hand' that was released March 25th 2016. Following the release of ‘Black Hand’ the group picked up Tony Garza on lead guitar and Cory McLain taking over bass and the new line-up toured the East Coast and Mid-West hitting major cities like NYC, Chicago, Philadelphia and others. TYRANT is currently arranging and writing material for their debut album expected Fall of 2018.\n\nDirector Name: Philip Winters \nProducer Name: Daniel Stephens and Philip Winters\n\nAbout the Video:“It’s about not wanting to be pushed into something that you believe is a hateful and bigoted world view – religion of any sorts – and still have to be subjected to it,” Winters said. “It’s an ode to people wanting to live their life on their own terms, without fear of some after-life punishment.”\n\nArtist Website: http://www.tyrantmetal.com \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TyrantMetalMusic\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/TyrantMetal\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/TyrantMetal\n\nLabel Name: Exmortis Records\nLabel Website: \n\nSong Lyrics: \"Fear of Faith\"\n\nEyes of the judging permeate\nMy flesh and bones ache with hate\nLiving a life that’s bereft of sin\nDoomed to the brimstone From the beginning\n\nFear of Faith\n\nFaith of Fear \n\nFear of Faith \n\nFaith of Fear\n\n\nMisandry feeds on the prayers you sing\n\nBound to the will of the Chosen King\n\nCrucify those that you deem as weak\n\nJust like the lies your silver tongue speaks\n\n\nFear of Faith\n\nFaith of Fear \n\nFear of Faith \n\nFaith of Fear\n\n\n\nFear of Faith\n\nFaith of Fear \n\nFear of Faith \n\nFaith of Fear\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pZle-PaH3NE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pZle-PaH3NE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pZle-PaH3NE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pZle-PaH3NE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pZle-PaH3NE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":80,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pZle-PaH3NE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/kMWWcfeNNPy0GCe8t5tRcbTxhco\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjYtb1lZQzE4Z1Fr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-09T00:11:51.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"American Standards - \"Weep\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - American Standards - \"Weep\" - Like this video?

While bands like Converge and Every Time I Die continue to release groundbreaking albums, newer acts such as Frontierer, Employed to Serve and The Armed serve up a fresh take on the style. This is where Phoenix, Arizona’s American Standards come in. Formed in 2011, the band has independently released four EPs and toured with some of the biggest names in and out of the extreme genre. Their newest offering 'Weep' was premiered May 18th, 2018 exclusively through Decibel Magazine.\nThe song, which could be teasing a new album to come, employs several of the staples that fans are accustomed to from instruments that erupt into chaos only to stop on a dime, to panic chords which lay the foundation for an unrestrained vocal delivered with the intensity of a screaming banshee. Where WEEP really shines though, is in its attention to song structure and dynamics. It’s these elements that give WEEP its replay value. Rather than being overly technical or heavy for the sake of heavy, it makes the song multidimensional, allowing listeners to really feel the emotion that the band speaks of below.\n“We all had a hell of a year. From losing friends and family to other struggles in our lives, it wasn’t hard to get down about stuff. It also wasn’t uncommon to be out having a good time when that heavy feeling would hit me like a tonof bricks. WEEP is about how your past can affect your present. Its about trying to put your life together after tragedy. It’s easy to dwell on negative experiences but at some point you have to decide to pull yourself up and change your perspective because at the end of the day, sometimes that’s all that you have control over.”-Brandon Kellum\nSo if you’re feeling the void left by bands such as The Chariot, Botch, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Coalesce and The Bled; check out American Standards.\n\nDirector Name: Elizabeth Hosier \nProducer Name: Hiram Hernandez \n\nArtist Website: https://fanlink.to/americanstandards\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/AmericanStandards\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/americanstndrds \nMyspace: http://www.myspace.com/AmericanStandards\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/AmericanStandards\nBandCamp: http://americanstndrds.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/AmericanStandards\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Weep\"\n\nI am the ghost\nHaunts of the past\nConfined to thoughts\nOf lost happiness \nI have been dragged deeper\nInto the void\n\nWill this end \nThis grief Inside for what I once held\nTime must change\nReaching for more from the bottom I dwell\nAll I hope\nThat this emptiness will soon pass\nHappiness\nA feeling of purpose I pray I can grasp\n\nReborn\nRevive\nI fight for \na new life\n\nAll I wanted\nWas to know of a purpose to feel like I belong\nBut knowing there was no support from you for so long\n\nYou linger\nIn the empty space inside my mind\nAll I want\nFight to distort what's engraved in my eyes\nSolitude \nA constant companion all to familiar\nI reach out \nBeing dragged deeper into the void \n\nI struggle\nI struggle\nI struggle\nI struggle\n\nEvery time I feel like I'm making progress\nThere's always a constant reminder \nThat dims the light \nThat shuts a door\nThat puts more weight on these shoulders \nI'm left crawling through life \nHoping to reach a place of contentment \nBut I’m lost \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-oYYC18gQk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-oYYC18gQk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-oYYC18gQk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-oYYC18gQk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-oYYC18gQk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":81,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6-oYYC18gQk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/2AXWLjW6TuPQPPsWWVwIGmwsDCI\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjVYRExWYVlvUXdR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-08T01:41:13.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Bitter Grounds - \"Two Sides of Hope\" Ring of Fire / Bad Granola / Aggrobeat / Mass Production","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Bitter Grounds - \"Two Sides of Hope\" - Like this video?

Fueled by 90's angst and underground aggression, the band distinguishes itself by perfectly balancing melody and grit, delivering a unique mixture of high energy punk rock and raw pounding ska songs, without losing sight of the essentials of good song writing. Bitter Grounds makes dynamic use of alternating dual vocals, backed up by straightforward guitars, edgy solos and pumping bass lines and drums. Lyrically the band doesn’t subscribe to any particular world-view. Independent in the truest sense, the band doesn’t conform to anything or anyone.\n\nDirector Name: Daan van Bergen\nProducer Name: Daan van Bergen\n\nAbout the Video: It's a punk rock video. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.bittergrounds.nl\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BitterGroundsBand\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bittergrounds\nBandCamp: https://bittergrounds.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bittergrounds_band\n\nLabel Name and website: \nRing of Fire Records - http://rof-records.blogspot.com/\nBad Granola Records - http://www.badgranola.co.uk/\nAggrobeat Records - http://aggrobeat.com\nMass Production Records - http://www.massprod.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Two Side of Hope\"\n\nThere’s a burned flag hung from the rafters.\nThere’s a hollow rallying call.\nSome insist they’re the people.\nOthers chime in ‘come one, come all.\nIntellectuals strike from the high ground\nStreet judges carry their flames\nThoroughly held beliefs in the foxholes  \nStrip ‘em all down and they’re all the same\nFor a better life, or a better future, cuz you know its gonna hurt.\nWhen two sides are marching.\nNo solutions, just illusions.\nVisions of a changing tide.\nDesperate to cling to a fusion.\nOf anger, and safety in numbers, and pride.\nRotten to the core, you hate to suffer, yet you beg for more.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XDLVaYoQwQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XDLVaYoQwQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XDLVaYoQwQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XDLVaYoQwQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XDLVaYoQwQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":82,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"5XDLVaYoQwQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/vi8aud17RzM9_pxhgfqOfsvFbX0\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnhBa21kT2VvWU5n","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-07T01:43:41.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Tents - \"Back Yards\" Badman Recording Co. - Official Music Video","description":"iTunes: http://geni.us/DeerKeepsPace\nAmazon: http://geni.us/DeerKeepsPace\nOther Purchase Link: http://www.badmanrecordingco.com\n\nTents - \"Back Yards\" Badman Recording Co. - Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: Portland, Oregon, U.S.A.\n\nArtist Biography: TENTS is a Portland based comfort-pop quartet currently touring in support of their forthcoming full-length 'Deer Keeps Pace' (Badman Recording Co.).\nThe title track from their debut LP 'Deer Keeps Pace' depicts a wild animal playfully running in stride with an old station wagon. The deer is a commentary on the constant threads in life. The ideas, feelings, and moments that stick with us and carry us through.\n\nTENTS built this record piece by piece as a crew in their Back Yard studio. More often than not, their songs are written live during stretches of deep studio time, improvising and responding intuitively to one another.\n\nLead track \"Backyards\" has already received commercial airplay on Portland, OR's KINK FM radio station. KINK named TENTS \"Artist of the Week.”\n\n\"[Amy's] background harmonies seem to echo a response to lead swooner Brian Hall’s optimistic, high visions of warmth and love unhindered. His own nonchalant, coffee sipping swagger carries a subtly-smooth country rhythm that gently layers with an underlying sense of melancholic fuzz.\" - All Things Go\n\n\nAbout the Video: \"This song is about on addiction as a destructive force, family as an uplifting force, and the two kind of, at battle with each other. I wrote this song when I was really sick. Not sleeping as much as I should, out drinking with buds on work nights. Turns out I have an autoimmune disease. Geez. So much body shit. In the end of this song, in the bridge, things take a turn a bit. It’s sort of like hapless, helpless, ironic ecstasy. But then also in there is a moment of letting go, which for me at the time very much resembled me shedding the addiction and allowing myself to enjoy my family.”\n\nArtist Website: http://www.tentspdx.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/tentsband\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/tentsband\nBandCamp: http://tentsband.bandcamp.com/releases\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/tentsband/\n\nLabel Name: Badman Recording Co. \nLabel Website: http://www.badmanrecordingco.com\n\nSong Lyrics: “Back Yards”\n \nSummer time \nI awaken and I’m coming down \nAll these vices and my vigor’s fading out \nTell my baby I will always be around (I will always be around) \n \nBeggar with a tall drink \nMan about town don’t know \nChipping off the years he \nDon’t get it don’t get it don’t know \n \nBaby’s in the bed sheets \nMomma's in the backyard singing so sweet \nTake another tall drink \nDon’t go don’t go you don’t get it no \n  \nIn a board book \nLittle orphan boy just tryin’ to work it out \nAll those fixes he’s just choking out the hound \nTell my baby I will always be around (I will always be around) \n  \nBeggar with a tall drink \nMan about town don’t know \nChipping off the years he \nDon’t get it don’t get it don’t know \n \nBaby’s in the bedsheets \nMomma's in the backyard singing so sweet \nTake another tall drink \nDon’t go don’t don’t don’t go you don’t get it no! \n \nI remember when my body was a racehorse singin' \nAle Ale \nI’m not quite six feet under \nI surrender to the lightning and the thunder screamin' \nAle Ale Ale Ale Ale  \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xAkmdOeoYNg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xAkmdOeoYNg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xAkmdOeoYNg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xAkmdOeoYNg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xAkmdOeoYNg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":83,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xAkmdOeoYNg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/bf71ad9hOo8SCPwCQbZDcHtc85M\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjJmb0ZBcFk0bFBJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-07T01:03:52.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Filthy Felons - \"Weakness Is a Magnet\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Filthy Felons - \"Weakness Is a Magnet\" - Like this video?

They have been growing ever stronger since starting out in 2014, playing heavy hitting tracks and making crowds throw down wherever they go. They're influences contain bands such as Everytime I Die, Comeback Kid, Feed the Rhino, and Thrice and they blend this together to form a mix that is both raw and melodic. Since playing live shows they have won one band competition after another, which started creating a buzz and increasing their presence in the Dutch heavy music scene. They've released they're first EP in 2017 with producer Daan Nieboer of hardcore band 18 Miles and are now preparing for the recording of their first full length album from which the first single has just been released called \"Weakness Is a Magnet\". The new track gives a glimpse of a heavier side of Filthy Felons and songs to come. In the meantime they are touring around Europe to get their name out there.\n\nDirector Name: Joost de Jonge\nDirector Link: http://www.joostdejonge.com\n\nAbout the Video: The song 'Weakness Is a Magnet' is about being your own worst enemy, or rather, getting trapped in a downward spiral of negativity from which there seems to be no escape. It is about trying to fight against a feeling of hopelessness and how difficult that struggle can be. In the music video, the protagonist is being confronted by his inner demons, but it remains unclear to the protagonist why they are haunting him. He seems to have fallen into a fugue state. Only traumatic flashbacks give him hints of what may have lead to an inescapable feeling of guilt and fear. The video is filled with and eerie interplay of dissonance and unpredictability, leaving the viewer able to identify with the sense of discomfort of the protagonist.     \n\nArtist Website: http://www.filthyfelons.nl\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/FilthyFelonsTwitter: \nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/filthyfelons\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Weakness Is a Magnet\" \n\nWith time working against me I wallow and worry\nWasting the minutes, I barely pull through\nSobriety's killing the nature of dreaming\nThis progress, is regress\n\nDown goes a fifth of whatever i'm clearing\nCan't keep my hands still, Lord knows that I've tried\nRegretting with reason, I've been here before\nIt's driving me out of my mind\n\nKicking, screaming, going down, I drown\nNow it’s clear, hate’s consumed what once was fear\nHold my breath and as i drown, i found\nNow it’s clear, hate is fear!\n\nI sleep trough the days just to make fewer hours\nDoubting and doomthinking mistakes made\nI carry a burden, weak willed and unwilling\nBut able as long as my back doesn't break\n\nI've been handed a shovel, given directions\nMaking my way towards a shallow grave\nLyring awake, I count stars and pray\nTo be covered with dirt that i've hidden away\n\nThis burden it better outweigh the outcome\nWas I given a use at birth\nAm I just a cancer that's killing the planet\n'Till death returns my shell to the earth\n\nKicking, screaming, going down, I drown\nNow it’s clear, hate’s consumed what once was fear\nHold my breath and as I drown, I found\nNow it’s clear, hate is fear!\n\nLeave no trace, lie in waste\nThere’s no need, no reason\nHang my head, facing death\nGot no need\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2foFApY4lPI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2foFApY4lPI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2foFApY4lPI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2foFApY4lPI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2foFApY4lPI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":84,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2foFApY4lPI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/53-a-P4eRv8iQQq1hqY_49O_Muw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnpuT2hySTFFNDBJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-07T00:31:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Awake in the Veil - \"The Underground\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Awake in the Veil - \"The Underground\" - Like this video?

Passionate and heavy, their twin lead vocal and guitar-driven sound never lets up thanks to the melodic and lyrical interplay between Jason Craig and Trison Boyes. Ethereal atmospherics give way to thunderous riffs, driving rhythms, and layers of deep groove courtesy of bassist Tim Saulnier. Anchored by the precise and powerful drumming of Craig Koziar, Jason and Trison’s guitars and voices soar triumphantly, sometimes accusingly, always with honest, often gut-wrenching emotion. \nDecisive and questioning lyrically, in many ways IDUNA’s music presents opposite sides of the same coin. This approach is reflected in their sensibilities that pay homage to the loud-soft dynamics of the grunge era and builds on the fundamental sounds of modern alternative rock with a deepening melodic intensity, clarity and stunning harmonies to match. Through their music, IDUNA carries a hope for the future while also pining for a past that is just out of reach.\n\nDirector Name: Sabreena Peters\nProducer Name: Sabreena Peters\n\nAbout the Video: \"Nosedive” is a song about the dangers of media messaging tactics that reinforce a false or questionable narrative. It’s a cautionary song that’s painfully relevant to both American & Canadian politics at this point in history. The music video is a visual manifestation of the sense of helplessness and frustration that the song embodies.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.idunamusic.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Idunamusic\nTwitter: @idunamusic\nBandCamp: https://iduna.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/idunamusic\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Nosedive\"\n\nWhile they talk that way\nThey don’t know the shadows of the steps they take\nTheir fucking parade\nWhile they talk that way\nReckless, careless, oh so dangerous,\nYou ain’t sorry\nA historic low\nLady liberty in tow\n\nWatch your step, watch your step \nOr nosedive down\nYou don’t look back, you don’t reflect, oh\nGuns for all and to all a good, good night\n\nWhile they write that way\nEyes eat up the headlines every day,\nStart twitchin’ away\nWhile they talk that way\nSpokesbot, spin doc, shady messengers\nWe’re all passengers\nA historic low\nA nuclear mistletoe\n\nWatch your step, watch your step\nOr nosedive down\nYou don’t look back, you just deflect, oh\nGuns for all and to all a good good night.\nSleep tight\n\nWatch your step, watch your step \nOr nosedive down\nYou don’t look back – you just attack\nGuns for all and to all a good good night, sleep tight\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9YnBv1rJQSs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9YnBv1rJQSs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9YnBv1rJQSs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9YnBv1rJQSs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9YnBv1rJQSs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":89,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9YnBv1rJQSs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/xRl8xg3PAfO9HDKsySzybkJxI68\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlgtWU81WHlDTHNz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-05T01:42:00.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Testify - \"Seeds of Wrath\" Van Richter Records","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Testify - \"Seeds of Wrath\" - Like this video?

Crack the Mind incorporates five brand new titles and four remix war titles from Mmmyaoooo.

Is there something to hide, or am I just blind? Why can't I see through this disguise? \n\nLately things seem strange, even though nothing has really changed. I find myself searching. Searching for motivation but all I get is frustration. Why can't I see what they see? \n\nThe designs not what it should be. Now I'm seeing flaws in everything. And i cant guarantee that i wont be leaving. \n\nChorus:\n\nThe colors fade as I walk away. There’s just no solace in this place. There’s no reaction. There's no satisfaction, I just need a trace. \n\nThese colors turn to grey. Broken and stripped away. The pain is all too much.This picture's crumbled to dust. \n\nI ask for too much pity. I know my worth, but I'm always forgetting. This painting, it's all grey, but it's still something I made. \n\nI'm taking things day by day, and hoping that I don't run away. I'm seeing this world with my own light, and maybe I'll see you here tonight. \n\nFor all those who feel insane, you can still illuminate. For all those that feel like me, you can still illuminate. Light the way! \n\nChorus:\n\nThe colors fade as I walk towards this place, there's no reaction. There's no satisfaction, I just need a trace.\n\nI need a trace, just in case I lose my way (I won't lose my way). Now I see there's more of me that belongs here, this is what I needed. \n\nLight the way! \n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KDbFsK6hBJI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KDbFsK6hBJI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KDbFsK6hBJI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KDbFsK6hBJI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KDbFsK6hBJI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":94,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"KDbFsK6hBJI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/FwzpkVHf3WX3HebxY5kwG1Zmq4w\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjhPOUY2dEY3NVJn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-01T21:28:41.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Pablo Arrieta Music - \"Always True\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Pablo Arrieta Music - \"Always True\" - Like this video?

Those fans include Sufjan Stevens and Sam Beam (Iron & Wine), who have both covered innocence mission songs, and in whose company the trio deserve to be bracketed.\n\"All I cannot say I hope you know, all you cannot say I hope I can hear,\" sings Karen Peris on \"Look Out from Your Window,\" the strong, circular, and somewhat quirky third track from the innocence mission's latest album, Sun on the Square. These lines, possibly spoken to her children -- one of whom actually plays viola on the song-- could be called emblematic for the album. \nIn their own way, Karen and her husband and fellow guitarist, Don Peris, have spent years trying to voice the inexpressible. Since forming the innocence mission in 1985 with Mike Bitts, upright bassist and friend from their Catholic high school, the dreamy, orchestral folk band have spent ten full-lengths speaking to our collective memory and awe at life’s mysteries. Their songs are full of sensory imagery and deeply felt instrumentation, and it's their unique way of trying to approach universal joys and sorrows that allows the band to achieve the emotional connection with their listeners that makes them so special.\n\"A most welcome return, from a truly treasured act, ‘Green Bus’ is an utterly captivating next-step in the innocence mission’s journey, in all the ways we’ve come to expect, and more so. Just like the steady passing of time, just like the world itself.” - Gold Flake Music UK\n\nDirector Name: Karen Peris\nProducer Name: Karen Peris\n\nArtist Website: http://www.theinnocencemission.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/innocence-mission-111422858887453/timeline/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timission\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theinnocencemission/\n\nLabel Name: Badman Recording Co. \nLabel Website: http://www.badmanrecordingco.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Green Bus\"\n \nDown this street, \nI ride a green bus,\nearly, deep into town.\nIf I could speak, if I could be\nas I would like to be now-\n \nand what could I bring you,\nnow in the meantime?\nFruit from the sunlight,\nquartz from the bay?\nAnd where will I find this,\nperfect and wondrous?\nI look into shops, \nI slip into rain.\n \nLeaves on leaves.\nI walk through deeply,\ngold, green, gold,\nfor my friend.\nI cannot find a thing\nbeautiful enough for you\nagain.\n \nAnd what could I bring you,\ntoday in the meantime?\nFruit from the sunlight,\nquartz from the bay?\nAnd where will I find this,\nperfect and wondrous?\nI look into shops,\nI slip into rain,\nslip into rain.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9yvcrEm7glY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9yvcrEm7glY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9yvcrEm7glY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9yvcrEm7glY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9yvcrEm7glY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":99,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9yvcrEm7glY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/12l13cDPx1ZVcQrk8lPomPYq19A\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lkx4YkVUNHBPdHNF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-31T18:58:02.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Eazyhead - \"Beehive Baby\" FilthyBroke Recordings","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Eazyhead - \"Beehive Baby\" - Like this video?

EAZYHEAD is hard to pin down, having worked in nearly every genre imaginable.  A one man band of sorts, his seasick guitars manifest in odd ballads, scathing \"punk,\" humorous psychedelic rock and so on.  He makes a lot of noise for one single human at the controls.  With FATEBREAKER we see EZ in top form, more controlled and focused with the arrangements and the fuzzy (often creepy) sounds of his brand of Rock & Roll are consistent throughout.  CNN seemed to explain things well regarding past output:\n\"Eazyhead is probably the most confusing artist of his generation. The project deliberately refuses to commit to any genre, effortlessly gliding from aggressive, trap-inspired hip-hop to slimy, delirious lo-fi pop, which ironically enough achieves a semblance of aesthetic cohesion by revolving around similar thematic concerns. Eazyhead’s music generates its own context, builds its own world through the pitiless deconstruction of conventional songwriting and an imaginative reconfiguration of it. A melting pot of genres suffused with both calm and chaos. - Macario Naval, CNN Philippines\"\n\nDirector Name: Raizer B. Kind\nProducer Name: Raizer B.

Hailing from Philadelphia, PA.  the band consists of Melissa Menago (vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist), Chris Kissel (guitarist), Keith Gill (drummer), and Lenny Sasso (bassist). The band strives to give their listeners a complete experience with their music. With amazing vocals, catchy beats, and an onstage performance that can’t be missed, June Divided strives to give their listeners a complete experience with their music.

We did the majority of the production on this song. We rented out a studio, Mel produced it and Chris engineered it. It was in the middle of a huge snow storm, and we got snowed into the studio without enough food and supplies. The experience definitely tested us, to say the least, but the final product made it all worth it. The four of us have been together for a long time, and I think the making of this song made our bond even stronger.\" -Melissa\n\nArtist Website: https://www.junedivided.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JuneDivided/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JuneDivided\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/junedivided\nBandCamp: https://junedivided.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/junedivided/\n\nLabel Name: Revival Recordings\nLabel Website: http://www.revivalrecs.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"I Didn't Mind\"\n\nI didn’t mind when I sat in traffic all throughout the night Cause I thought it over I didn’t care when you and I were fine with headed nowhere Til you weren’t there And I didn’t mind That song I never really liked because you’re gone and now I miss the way you sing it And it was fine When I used to dream about you at least then I got to see you around sometime I didn’t mind, I didn’t mind Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Oooo and I didn’t mind, I didn’t mind Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Time, always slowing down for you and I But it couldn’t save us Taking me under, we were lonely prisoners together But you left me hanging out to dry But you changed your mind I was high and you were falling, now I’m falling farther than you ever knew And I was alright With the pictures never taken, I was fine just wasting all that time with you I didn’t mind, I didn’t mind Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Oooo and I didn’t mind, I didn’t mind Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart I didn’t mind, til you kept a little bit of my heart I didn’t mind, I didn’t mind Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Oooo and I didn’t mind, I didn’t mind Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart I didn’t mind, I didn’t mind Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Oooo and I didn’t mind, I didn’t mind Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart Til you kept a little bit of my heart\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5F6bTYXCEnU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5F6bTYXCEnU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5F6bTYXCEnU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5F6bTYXCEnU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5F6bTYXCEnU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":101,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"5F6bTYXCEnU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/lkqqUKDb_hnR4RfwIGh4utSvYho\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlNENklBMkp1Q0NF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-31T02:56:22.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"A While Away - \"Chariot of Wolves\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - A While Away - \"Chariot of Wolves\" - Like this video?

Described as drawing from punk, post-punk, grunge, alternative and new wave, Castle Black refuses to be pinned down to a genre.  Each song careens through an almost stream of consciousness depiction of life stories, social anthems and raw emotions.  Gritty female vocals, roaring drums, melodic bass and guitar-forward hooks collide, staying in your head for days on end.\nTheir first EP, 'Find You There', was released in August 2015, with a follow-up single 'Dark Light: A Plague Revisited' released in May 2016. Their second EP, 'Losing Forever', as well as their video for \"Dark Light\" were released in October 2016.  A limited-edition lathe-cut record for their single \"Blind Curtain\" was released in April 2017, on Leesta Vall Sound Recordings. Their third studio EP, Trapped Under All You Know, was released in August 2017.  \"Seeing in Blue\" premiered on The Big Takeover, followed by a full EP premiere on AXS. The video for \"Seeing in Blue\" was released in December 2017, and will be followed up by the video for \"Broken Bright Star\" in April 2018.    The fourth studio EP will be released in summer 2018, and includes mixes from Mark Plati (known for his work with David Bowie, among others).  \n\nDirector Name:  Jeff Allyn Szwast\nProducer Name:  Jeff Allyn Szwast\n\nAbout the Video: Castle Black's latest video for \"Broken Bright Star\" explores the group's affinity for spells, dark magic, and pagan-inspired rituals.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.castleblackmusic.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/castleblackmusic/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CastleBlackNYC\nBandCamp: https://castleblack.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/castleblacknyc/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0qPZIi8AsXDGzYOdi2hoiI\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rti9yT5re_c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rti9yT5re_c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rti9yT5re_c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rti9yT5re_c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rti9yT5re_c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":109,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rti9yT5re_c"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/6YI4e-pS2sZdu8oz5Ee7uhG_FHU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjZGNG13UFU3eVFV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-30T02:10:36.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"CC - \"Wasteland\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - CC - \"Wasteland\" - Like this video?

Is it just an ego project fueled by a “LOOK AT ME” motivation? Is it musical therapy for a confused soul? Is it a totally meaningless art venture?\n\nThe name TDW and the associated band Dreamwalkers Inc stand for a philosophy that Tom has been trying to express since he was a very young age:\n\n“Pure expression through multiple art forms; Scoring emotions by the day”\n\nThis description sounds vague, but it symbolizes the main attitude that is behind this project and its output. TDW is not just a band that makes music that fits in genre A or B and Dreamwalkers Inc is not just a live band playing rock shows. It’s a total musical and visual experience that strives to communicate emotion no matter what artistic vehicle is chosen to achieve that.\n\nTDW was founded by Tom de Wit when he was 14 years old. As a self-thought, non experienced writer & musician, the chances of him succeeding at actually making something listenable/watchable were highly unlikely… If one thing, the career path of TDW has proven that perseverance and hard work pay off as a growing catalog of multiple well received albums and video productions have shown over the last couple of years.\n\nDeveloping himself as a singer, multi-instrumentalist and producer in both video and audio, Tom used the TDW project as a way to expand his skills and his library of creations. The lyrics (also written by him) focus on the human psyche and emotions. Big themes as life and death are tackled next to subjects such as politics and sociological issues. All these subjects and themes come from Tom’s mind and heart, making each song an emotionally charged statement in itself. The music of TDW has been an ever-evolving and expanding musical journey. Metallic and aggressive sounds on one side are combined with melodic and sensitive sounds on the other. The clash between these musical worlds creates a sound that sounds pleasantly familiar, yet new and adventurous.\n\nSince 2016 Tom has surrounded himself with a host of band members to perform his music live. This band is entitled Dreamwalkers Inc. Tom wanted to have a big band around him to perform the music in exactly the way he saw it in his mind’s eye. The band reflects the way the music is written and made as this is not just a metal band, but a band that can both play intimate, sensitive acoustic sets as well as full blown metal shows with all canons blazing. So far the band has performed a hand full of gigs, but these include a debut gig at Prog Power as well as an album release show that showed an energetic live band with the intent to create an experience that is both diverse & entertaining, as well as layered & thought provoking.\n\nSo perhaps it is due to finally answer the question: What is TDW?\n\nWell, it just IS what it is. And you can come along for the ride if you want to!\n \nDirector Name: Tom de Wit\nDirector Link: https://www.thesuite.nl\nProducer Name: Tom de Wit\nProducer Link: https://www.thesuite.nl\n\nAbout the Video: The video for \"Happy Day\" combines live footage from the first gigs the band played in their short existence, interspersed with artwork for the song and the songs' lyrics on screen. The song deals with mourning and coming to terms with loss and what it can do to someone's psyche to lose someone dear and how to cope with that.

Due out on June 29th - almost 20 years to the day of the album’s original release date - the first (and only) live album from the rock ’n’ roll icons, comprises a double-LP set and features a replica of the rare poster that came with the original 1998 pressing (featuring frontman Mike Ness on stage). The set includes such favorites as “Bad Luck,” “Mommy’s Little Monster” and a cover of Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire.” Typical of Social Distortion’s reputation, the band performs with a fierce energy onstage and Live at the Roxy captures this intensity.\n\nFormed in 1979, the Southern California band have come to be known for their distinctive brand of hard rockabilly and punk that’s cut with Ness’ melodic lyrics, chronicling hard-luck tales of love, loss and lessons learned. The band first erupted onto the scene with their debut, 1983’s Mommy’s Little Monster, but it was their third album, 1990’s Social Distortion, which broke them into mainstream success, garnering the rockers their first Gold Record, with hits like “Ball and Chain” and “Story of My Life” (live versions of which are featured on this reissue).\n\nNow in their fourth decade, and with seven studio albums under their belt, Social Distortion are showing no signs of slowing down. Most recently, the band released a 4-LP retrospective box set, The Independent Years, chronicling their output from 1983-2004. The set includes classic albums such as Mommy’s Little Monster and Prison Bound. Currently working on a new album, the band has spent much of the last year on the road and will continue to tour throughout the summer (tour dates below).\n\nThe album is available to pre-order now as a 2-LP vinyl set, and also on limited-edition green smoke-colored vinyl (1,000 pieces), exclusively via the Official Social Distortion Store.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.socialdistortion.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/socialdistortion\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SocialD1\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nA1: Story of My Life\nA2: Bad Luck\nA3: Under My Thumb\nA4: Prison Bound\n \n\nB1: Mommy’s Little Monster\nB2: Mass Hysteria\nB3: The Creeps\nB4: Another State of Mind\nB5: Let It Be Me\n\nC1: No Pain, No Gain\nC2: Cold Feelings\nC3: Telling Them\nC4: I Was Wrong\nC5: 1945\n\nD1: Don’t Drag Me Down\nD2: Ball & Chain\nD3: Ring of Fire\n\n2018 Summer Tour:\n\n6.01 | San Francisco, CA at The Masonic\n6.02 | Rohnert Park, CA at SOMO Village Event Center\n6.03 | Redding, CA at Redding Civic Auditorium\n6.05 | Seattle, WA at Showbox SoDo\n6.07 | Seattle, WA at Showbox SoDo\n6.09 | Vancouver, BC at Commodore Ballroom\n6.12 | Calgary, AB at MacEwan Hall\n6.13 | Edmonton, AB at Union Hall\n6.15 | Edmonton, AB at Union Hall\n6.16 | Saskatoon, SK at O’Brians Event Centre\n6.17 | Winnipeg, MB at Burton Cummings Theatre\n6.20 | Des Moines, IA at Brenton Skating Plaza\n6.22 | Chicago, IL at House of Blues\n6.23 | Chicago, IL at House of Blues\n6.27 | Columbus, OH at Express Live!\n6.28 | Sauget, IL at Pop’s Nightclub & Concert Venue\n6.29 | Milwaukee, WI at Summerfest\n7.02 | Lincoln, NE at Bourbon Theatre\n7.04 | Denver, CO at Fox Street Compound\n7.06 | Salt Lake City, UT at The Depot\n7.07 | Boise, ID at Knitting Factory\n7.08 | Bend, OR at Midtown Ballroom\n7.10 | Spokane, WA at Knitting Factory\n7.11 | Portland, OR at Roseland Theater\n7.14 | Colwood, BC at Rock the Shores Festival\n7.17 | Sacramento, CA at Ace of Spades\n7.19 | Sacramento, CA at Ace of Spades\n7.20 | Avila Beach, CA at Avila Beach Resort\n\nRecord Label: Craft Recordings\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/craftrecordingsofficial/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/craftrecordings/ \nhttps://twitter.com/craftrecordings\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsx6vv8izcm9T857KduEcwA\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxtchvSl6U/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxtchvSl6U/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxtchvSl6U/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxtchvSl6U/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":115,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"OxxtchvSl6U"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/xY39wDBKopr8NU1aXc-dP6dEIf8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjJwdmFpcXBSZGY0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-25T21:33:33.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Sharks Come Cruisin' - \"Running Down to Cuba\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Sharks Come Cruisin' - \"Running Down to Cuba\" - Like this video?

With a theatrical sound and live performance inspired by acts including Coldplay, Panic! At The Disco, and Imagine Dragons, If Walls Could Talk aim to create an experience for their fans. The band's name stems from the idea that in a sense they relate to metaphorical walls, not because of what they do, but because of what they cannot do: speak. We have voices, but through music the band is able to do so by telling stories in ways that are meaningful enough to convey how they feel. \n\nSince the band's formation, If Walls Could Talk have worked on creating a sound that is all their own. In 2016 the band released their debut EP, What Would They Say?, which features tracks that are structured like a classical aria while others blend elements of rock, rap, and pop. With their energetic and interactive live performances, the band has a talent for connecting with fans and have shared the stage with artists including Joyce Manor, Foxing, Basement, Norma Jean, and Andrea Gibson. Now If Walls Could Talk has returned with What Would They Say? Deluxe Edition, set for release on June 8th, 2018, that includes new tracks as well as three revisionist acoustic tracks. Vocalist Anthony Berkseth shares, \"When we recorded the original album, it was our best work we had in us at the time. Now we've only built upon that, and we're so happy with what was created.\"\n\nDirector Name: Michael Martenson of Undead Media\nProducer Name: Michael Martenson and Tony Composeo of Undead Media\n\nAbout the Video: \"Static\" captures some of the band's most raw emotions, showcasing the frustration felt by someone who put their whole heart into another only to be betrayed. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ifwallscouldtalkband\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/iftalkingwalls \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ifwallscouldtalkband\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Static\"\n\nI feel like cursing out your name\nCuz I know you’re the one to blame\nAnd all these tricks get to my head\nYou make me feel like I am dead \n\nChorus\nYou feel so static to me, I can’t take you seriously anymore\nAnd when this conversation rises in the morning, will you take the floor?\nI’m not okay\nI can’t forget you\nDon’t feel insane\nBut I kinda want to\nYou feel so static to me, I can’t take you seriously anymore\n\nI know you’re gonna fight it, I know you’re gonna fight it\nCuz every time you’re hiding your feelings\nBut even now, there’s no fuck (time) worth givin’\nI’ll just go on pretending I’m livin’    \n\nChorus\n\nDon’t tell me I can’t get a little suspicious\nAurguments getting visious\nI don’t want to let you go\nBut you will have to let me know\n\nCuz it’s not clear what you want from me, no\nAnd all I hearin is a static\nAn addict would leave and let you go, so soon\nBut maybe thats whats wrong with me\nGet too involved just so I can write a song or three\nGive it right back this smack talk lacks all that\nI can even handle\nRhyming is a scandal\nGive or take\nYou live to break me, well darlin'\nYou just got your wish\nCuz I can't even hear you anymore\n\nChorus\n\n(slowly you’re fading out)\n(slowly you’re fading out)\n(slowly you’re fading out)\n(slowly you’re fading out)\n(slowly you’re fading out)\n(slowly you’re fading out)\n(slowly you’re fading out)\n(slowly you’re fading out)\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cwPb_fs1w4c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cwPb_fs1w4c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cwPb_fs1w4c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cwPb_fs1w4c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cwPb_fs1w4c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":117,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"cwPb_fs1w4c"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/LV5auDJeyqSdXCV6oEuC4tklVEU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnJ6YVpxRTB2S01z","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-25T20:56:57.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Sounds like Disco - \"Falling\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.TranqTV.com - Sounds like Disco - \"Falling\" - Like this video?

With lots of line-up changes over the years that would take couple of paragraphs to describe, band started to shape up and thrive at the end of 2016, when Dom Kuzniar joined Mat, Mariusz and Aaron as a drummer. Short after, Aaron -long time member of the band has decided to left the band pursuing his other ventures, and has been replaced by Matt Haynes on vocals. In the last six months of hard work and commitment, we have been working hard on our stuff, and we hope that everyone who land here will enjoy it as we do! \n \nStylistically inspired by 90's and early 2000's nu-metal, we are a band focused on creating energetic and hard hitting music. Melodic hooks are combined with powerful vocals to deliver meaningful lyrics, while the coupling of dynamic guitar riffs and heavy drumming creates a solid backbone for our songs.\n \nDirector Name: Mateusz Augustyniak\nProducer Name: Mateusz Augustyniak\n\nAbout the Video: Lyric video to our second single\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dialektband/\nBandCamp: http://dialektband.bandcamp.com\n \nSong Lyrics: \"Speak to Me\"\n\nSpeak to me again lonely voice by my head\nSpeak up, speak up if you want to be heard\nSpeak to me again lonely voice by my head\nAnd whisper, whisper what I need to be heard\n \nHere I go\nOne more time, over your head\n \nI can't see why you'd leave me here\nI can't see why\n \nCome on come on, lonely girl to my room\nCome on, this day couldn't come far too soon\nTake off your shirt, lonely voice by my head\nAnd whisper whisper what I need to be heard\n \nHere I go\nOne more time over your head\n \nGhost be good to me\nGhost be good to me\nAnd do your thing for me\nYou know it feels so…! \n \nTake me now, take me now\nShow me how\n \nHere I go\none more time over your head\n \nYEEEEAH\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9WJu2ALiIs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9WJu2ALiIs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9WJu2ALiIs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9WJu2ALiIs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9WJu2ALiIs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":120,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"B9WJu2ALiIs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/hStpOpxXj2QA8nj9ZuzjZXwHpws\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LklXbnJOZzNKRnFr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-24T22:16:34.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Lonesome Heroes - \"Ride or Die\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Lonesome Heroes - \"Ride or Die\" - Like this video?

KrankTV.com!\n \n***\nCosmogyral - \"Age of Reason\" A BlankTV World Premiere!\n \nArtist city, country: Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S.A.\n \nArtist Biography: Originally formed in 2014, the band decided to forego the traditional route of playing gigs until they had an offering for the masses. Now, with the release of BEHOLD, their debut full-length album, Cosmogyral has created 12 tracks and over 60 minutes of high-energy, groove-oriented material; they are ready to take the world of metal by storm. \nInfluenced by the likes of Metallica's James Hetfield and Chuck Schuldiner's band Death, just to name a few, guitarist Dee Mulligan's work creates an epic landscape; he is able to fluidly weave advanced techniques into a sound that can only be described as “Intricate Simplicity”. Backed by Erik Lissabet's smooth basslines and the grooves of drummer Raffi Lamardo's accent based style, the creation is further enhanced.\n\nNewest member, guitarist Eric Estrada, coming from a thrash background, adds to the dynamic of fast picking and soaring leads, which can only intensify future compositions. Sean Adams is the final piece of this puzzle. His range combines crushing lows, aggressive mids, and highs that cut like a knife; along with crisp and clean vocals to compliment any situation. Blending these multiple styles with vocal melodies that cascade over the music like the currents of a raging river.\nCosmogyral is a band that is all about the feel; using tempo, tone, and note selection to envelope the listener with a wall of sound and energy on each track.\n\n\nDirector Name: Black Sheep Media\nDirector Link: https://blacksheepmedia.net\n \nArtist Website: http://www.cosmogyralofficial.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/cosmogyralband\nTwitter: https://www.facebook.com/Cosmogyralband/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjUa1Chi5bk5S-E6saJl49g\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/user-188025812\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/artist/cosmogyral\n \nSong Lyrics: \"Age of Reason\"\n\nAcross the sea\nThere lies a land that's rising\nFrom the abyss\nShe's calling us to share her promise\n\nFor I have seen\nThis golden future lain before me\nMastering\nAll knowledge through our gathering\nWe've....\n\nRode the storm\nMine eyes see a distant shore\nThe time is nigh, to lay our claim\nUpon the tor\n\n\nWe deplore the violence\nQuietly reflect in silence\nThat timeless treason\nTo bring about an Age of Reason\n\n\nWe've reached the shore\nAll hail the New Atlantis\nKneel and rejoice\nUpon this land of endless promise\n\nFor we believe\nOur progeny will reap the rewards\nOf our time\nReaching forth for reason as they \n\nRide the storm\nTheir minds lie upon the shore\nThe time is nigh, the search for truth's\nAn endless war\n\n\nWe deplore the violence\nQuietly reflect in silence\nThat timeless treason\nTo bring about an Age of Reason\n\nFutures lie before us\nThe path to logic's door is...\nOpen to all those\nWho seek to procure\n\nFruit from the tree of knowledge\nLet thy heart acknowledge\nIts calling to you\nTo thine own self be true\n\n\nMy New Atlanteans, you shall be learned in your ways\nThe knighted Viscount Bacon, is our eruditely sage\nAnd through his wisdom we can change, this world for all mankind, \nAnd the light of truth shall reign\n\n\nWe hold the hope of a new world born, as we sail through the icy winds\nThe agents of the Rose and Cross, will bring forth life again\n\n“Enlightened” ways, of fear and hate, will not be recognized\nAs knowledge brings, the tree of life, we cast aside the holy lies\n\n\nBehold the light, behold the way that saves us from this agonizing hell\n\n\nAcross the sea\nThere lies a land that's rising\nFrom the abyss\nShe's calling us to share her promise\n\nFor I have seen\nThis golden future lain before me\nMastering\nAll knowledge through our gathering\nWe've....\n\nRode the storm\nMine eyes see a distant shore\nThe time is nigh, to lay our claim\nUpon the tor\n\n\nWe deplore the violence\nQuietly reflect in silence\nThat timeless treason\nTo bring about an Age of Reason\n\nFutures lie before us\nThe path to logic's door is...\nOpen to all those\nWho seek to procure\n\nFruit from the tree of knowledge\nLet thy heart acknowledge\nIts calling to you\nTo thine own self be true\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fikQ2VrHyzA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fikQ2VrHyzA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fikQ2VrHyzA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fikQ2VrHyzA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fikQ2VrHyzA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":122,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"fikQ2VrHyzA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/0-xiysNNk3gpAxtV4j5OKrUj5g8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk5yQjJubFRyWkY0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-24T17:40:58.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Nancy No Shoes - \"Crimes against Humonarchy\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Nancy No Shoes - \"Crimes against Humonarchy\" - Like this video?

She left Canada for the UK, where she was born, to pursue a career in music. She achieved international chart status with her hit \"Fascinating Rhythm\" on (Virgin Records) a song she wrote and performed with William Orbit. Then she was asked by Warner Brothers UK to work with jazz pianist Julian Joseph on his album The Language of Truth. Sharon performed Curtis Mayfield's soul classic, The Other Side of Town.\nAfter a career of touring all parts of the world, Singing in Commercials and constantly honing in on her writing abilities, she returned to Canada to settle down. \nSharon’s new album is entitled “Sha’s Archives”. The A in Sha, is a long vowel. She calls it an archival project for many reasons but mainly it’s based on all she has been through since the last album “Outflow.” Backed by her team once again, L. Stu Young and Peter Grimmer, who’s jazz inspired track “Sha’s Archives,” an instrumental, is also featured.

A midlife crisis? Perhaps.\nEither way, Colonel Sun is the brainchild of Montreal-native Scott Cook (formerly Dead Days, Ablyss, Bodyjarr). On the edge of abandonment, Scott realized that he had a few more stories to tell. So, armed with his guitar, his voice, and his laptop, he took a journey through a mind full of memories, anecdotes, and sarcasm. To Scott's surprise, this journey culminated in an invasion of sorts—a suburban invasion, in fact—and, in the blink of an eye, a musical battle plan had been laid. Proudly, Scott promoted himself to Colonel. However, he quickly realized that an invasion of this scale could not be fought alone. Enter longtime comrades Mishka Stein and Robbie Kuster (of Patrick Watson) as well as Simon Angell (of Thus Owls). Without hesitation, this fearless trio assumed their stations and the four brave soldiers entered the battlefield...\n \nNow, Montreal-based Colonel Sun is a rock n' roll band, inspired by music that is charged by feel and emotion. Compared to bands such as Mudhoney, Failure, and Helmet, Colonel Sun clearly runs on fuel from the '90s. However, the members' collective musical background is so eclectic that the band's dirty-rock edge is, at times, polished by musically-progressive overtones. \n \nSince the release of Colonel Sun's debut EP, 'Suburban Invasion' (released April 2017), the band has been receiving positive attention that has included airplay (CHOM 97.7, CJLO, CKUT) and interviews (Bucketlist Music Reviews), and has performed at local venues including Turbo Haus, Barfly, La Vitrola, and Bar Le Ritz. The band just opened up for New York hardcore legend Harley Flanagan (Cro Mags) at Coop Katacombs, and will perform at Pouzza Fest 2018. So keep an ear out, 'cause this battle has only just begun!!\n\nDirector Name: Scott Cook\nProducer Name: Scott Cook\n\nAbout the Video: \"Suburban Invasion\" is a song about sticking with it... start when you're young, and just keep going... The video features Brazilian Jiu Jitsu champion Leonardo \"Cascao\" Saggioro (Brazilian Top Team).\n\nArtist Website: http://colonelsun.bandcamp.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/colonelsunband\nBandCamp: http://colonelsun.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: @colonelsunband\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Suburban Invasion\"\n\nLittle boy, big dreams, \nStart a band for all his friends to see... \nRetrace your steps… Look up!! \n\nShiny boots, long coat, \nLoud music is what boy likes the most... \nKeep it up!! \n\nOnly young, wants to rage, \nWith slammin' punks and girls all twice his age... \nFake cards, peach fuzz… Good luck!! \n\nOpen eyes, open wide, \nThe boy knows he'll make the scene in time... \nKeep it up!! \n\n(Retake, rewind, retrace your steps) \n\nNow he's old and lookin' back, \nRemembering the shows, the pit, the black... \nRetake, rewind… Pick it up!! \n\nLookin' back, he's gotta grin, \nThat little punk has hardly changed a bit... \nKeep it up!! \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tYSLgnSNYH0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tYSLgnSNYH0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tYSLgnSNYH0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tYSLgnSNYH0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tYSLgnSNYH0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":138,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"tYSLgnSNYH0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/IhKFifQKSUpu4JZwz_sft1Hvlsw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lmc2ZjJfcG01NnR3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-19T23:19:28.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Realms - \"Hung.Drawn.Quartered.\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Realms - \"Hung.Drawn.Quartered.\" - Like this video?

For Texas indie rockers Corusco, the search for balance is their driving force. Blending elements of indie rock and folk with an aggressive edge, their music brings a balance of ‘punch-you-in-the-gut’ rock and delicate moments of vulnerability. Literally meaning \"I shine, I quiver, I flicker\" in Latin, the name Corusco conveys the inner battle between happiness and sorrow, experiencing darkness and light at the same time - like light coruscating off water. What started as an acoustic project with vocalist/guitarist Aaron Gonzalez during Fall of 2015, would eventually form into a full band with the addition of bassist Philip Baugh and round out with drummer Carlos Garza. The collection of songs written on the band’s first tour together would become their debut EP, 'Don’t Give Up', released in 2016.\n\nAfter a period of playing shows around the country, opening for bands like Valleyheart (Rise Records) and Get Dead (Fat Wreck) in addition to performing at festivals such as MR Fest and Loud!Fest, Corusco would return to the studio in 2017. With the help of producer Aaron Gillespie (Underoath, The Almost), the band tracked and recorded seven songs for their debut full-length album, 'Wake'. Set for release on May 25th, 2018, Wake is inspired by the idea that each song on it’s own is a piece of a larger mosaic that come together to recreate a variety of memories encapsulated within the album. \n\nProduction and videography: Fidelis Creative Agency\n\nAbout the Video: The video features a recreation of the night that inspired the lyrics behind the track which describes a first kiss that felt as if it were plucked right out of a movie. The video features a close friend from the band, Aleenah, who was around to see the band's lead singer, Aaron Gonzalez, fall in love with the girl who \"New Year\" is about. \n\nArtist Website: http://coruscomusic.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/coruscomusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/coruscomusic \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/coruscomusic/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"New Year\"\n\nIt sends chills down your neck What did you expect if you don’t dress for the cold? We walk these streets among the trees With the lights strung up, your eyes light up I see you glow as the sound is fading Please hold me, because my hands are shaking Is this what you’ve waited for? This is all I’ve waited for As the clock unwinds on us... I will see you in a new year, if your kiss is still around As the clock unwinds, your lips touch mine Wide eyed. Breathe in. The moment hangs like pictures. My hands. Your back. Everything in slow motion Lips touch. Exhale. The music implodes backwards. Take my hand, it’s the only thing that’s keeping us on the ground I’m breathless, you’re reeling… You’re the only real thing I know\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awbMaqGP4fY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awbMaqGP4fY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awbMaqGP4fY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awbMaqGP4fY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awbMaqGP4fY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":145,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"awbMaqGP4fY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/QgFt9hi3dAwKHJvbXKXtthcuOjU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnRhVV8zaVU0TUN3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-16T00:29:32.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Exeguesis - \"Plaga\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Exeguesis - \"Plaga\" - Like this video?

Because the traps are hidden in plain sight. What's done is done, there's no looking back. Can't fall behind. I'm out of my cage, Its \"sink or swim\", its \"live or die\". As you grew old in age, i grew so cold in rage. Now times are changing from bad to worse, But i'm still the same. Still the same against this world. Till my dying day, till my final breath, against a world i don't belong. On this life we never find peace, Daily struggles that will never cease. we live, we lie, we love, we die.... Striving to survive, But I'm still defiant! And will remain defiant! Standing through the tests of time... Never fall in line. The world keeps spinning, but going in reverse. Hard times have changed me, yet I am still the same. Live and learn, never forget of the choices and the paths we have take, No remorse, no regret. Always two steps ahead. \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCoyGKSSALs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCoyGKSSALs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCoyGKSSALs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCoyGKSSALs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCoyGKSSALs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":149,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rCoyGKSSALs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/HU882vOLiGwSH4TF-yGgcvRo4Zo\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnNmT3gxdE01X19n","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-16T01:14:13.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Captain Kaiser - \"Tsunami\" Bearded Punk Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Captain Kaiser - \"Tsunami\" - Like this video?

It’s all hanging on you.  Just make your move before you have no move to make.  There's no future, there’s no lighthouse on the lake.  You're just rambling through endless corridors—a mouse lost in a maze.  You gotta calm yourself and try to concentrate: What \nsurvives in the fire?  What small fragment after all else disintegrates?  I come home and the door is hanging open, the smoke alarm is howling, the bathroom mirror is broken and find you standing in the backyard pouring gas on a bonfire.  Ass-naked in the middle of December.  The shame you don't recall with the clothes you don't remember in flames.  Tearing pages of notebooks in the embers.  Your makeshift funeral pyre. Toss and turn all night then it comes to me. You can't shake out the shards in your memory.  So you're engaged in this scorched earth policy until there’s nothing.  Later on claiming wolves replaced your family, you raised your hand against me with the newspaper you can't read, then you wrapped yourself in an op-ed on the construct of history. The mark of time is elaborately long.  It’s a spirograph drawn with no breaks.  Just goes on and on.  Yet here we are on the cutting room floor splicing fugues where they don't belong.  Toss and turn all night but there's no relief.  I went into your room, you were sound asleep.  So I stayed for awhile watching you grind your teeth.  When you wake, there's a moment as you rise.  You feel it all coming back and you realize you tried to amputate the parts that made you scared to die.  Now it'll kill you if you let it.  You’re a black hole bending light beams backwards. Center caving, self collapsing inwards.  Against the infinite you have no stature. Shrinking infinitely out of the picture.  Look for the lever, try to break the pattern.  Single crocus in the dead of winter.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ji5SH0IoGlc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ji5SH0IoGlc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ji5SH0IoGlc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ji5SH0IoGlc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ji5SH0IoGlc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":152,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Ji5SH0IoGlc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/dsn1z75AGRSbMkPixStz7gt13Gw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm9LTGFBUnNSZ0NN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-15T00:58:28.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Cristian - \"Weight of the World\" Hook and Rhyme Records","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Cristian - \"Weight of the World\" - Like this video?

His acclaimed two-piece AATS drew global audiences and earned him a featured Up-and-Comer slot at the Iceland Airwaves Festival. Building off the success of AATS, Aaron Rice wrote and recorded his first solo album last year while living in L.A., and produced and mixed the tracks in New York City with long-time collaborator and experimental ambient composer Grant Cutler. The forthcoming LP weaves together musical influences of a 90’s kid growing up mixed-race in the Midwest (N64’s Wave Race meets TLC) with sparse trap hi-hats and probing lyrics. The result is a declaration at a dance party; an emotive sound story as rich as its roots. Performing material from the forthcoming solo debut, he’s shared stages with Gold Panda, Crystal Castles and Open Mike Eagle.\n\nDirector Name: Wolves \nProducer Name: Aaron Rice\n\nArtist Website: http://www.aaronriiice.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/aaronriiice\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/aaronriiice\nBandCamp: http://www.aaronriiice.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/aaronriiice\nSoundCloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/aaronriiice\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TG7n7r2JO-8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TG7n7r2JO-8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TG7n7r2JO-8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TG7n7r2JO-8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TG7n7r2JO-8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":158,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"TG7n7r2JO-8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/3p9NUjXxe9jxtmQmkwe4u-pesMQ\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnBYVk5keWZ6VnZz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-12T22:12:35.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Destroying Laser - \"W.I.L.D.\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Destroying Laser - \"W.I.L.D.\" - Like this video?

Vocalists Amy and Brian are partners, and parents. In spite of the band's domestic infatuation, this music does not hide at home. it teems with optimism and newness beneath a shimmering, contemplative shell. \n\nThe title track from their debut LP 'Deer Keeps Pace' depicts a wild animal playfully running in stride with an old station wagon. The deer is a commentary on the constant threads in life. The ideas, feelings, and moments in life that stick with us and carry us through.\n\nTENTS built this record piece by piece as a crew in their Back Yard studio. More often than not, their songs are written live during stretches of deep studio time, improvising and responding intuitively to one another. \n\nMagic spouts effortlessly through this music. It feels like a bunch of kids laughing and shouting from the recesses of a playground, inviting the cynics and the skeptics and the wallflowers to join the fun.\n\nDirector Name: Everett Nate Yockey\nProducer Name: Everett Nate Yockey\n\nAbout the Video: Filmed in a secret way on a Red Scarlett on a custom dolly\n\nArtist Website: http://www.tentspdx.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tentsband/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tentsband\nBandCamp: http://tentsband.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram:http://instagram.com/tentsband\n\nLabel Name: Badman Recording Co.\nLabel Website: http://www.badmanrecordingco.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Light Light Weight\" \n\nOld grave buried in the water\nBuried in the current where the children play\n\nOld gold, tarry ‘neath the surface\nbathe me in your surges while I set my gaze\n\nI am here!\nMy weakness I now willingly expose\nI’m afraid\nBut I was born\nTo be powerful and powerless and glow\n\nYoung dove staring at her lover\nContent inside her body to be made known\nOld shame runnin’ from the oozie\nGettin’ kinda woozy ‘neath the light light weight\n\nI am here!\nMy weakness I now willingly expose\nI’m afraid\nBut I was born\nTo be powerful and powerless and glow\n\nI am here!\nMy weakness I now willingly expose\nI’m afraid\nBut I was born\nTo be powerful and powerless and glow\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f9WwCcQ0oOI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f9WwCcQ0oOI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f9WwCcQ0oOI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f9WwCcQ0oOI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f9WwCcQ0oOI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":165,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"f9WwCcQ0oOI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/lbGFTQBEjTXHFoKblaAD137vuFo\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnpXUFlKMnR3WnVZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-08T19:36:20.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Oracle - \"Drafted\" Rain without End Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Oracle - \"Drafted\" - Like this video?

All three members are formerly of rap/rock band, From Ashes to New (Better Noise Records). The new project marks a much anticipated derailment from their rap/rock past.

We've drawn comparisons to bands such as Breaking Benjamin, Killswitch Engage, and Eyes Set to Kill. We've been active since 2014, and are releasing our 3rd EP on June 9th, 2018, entitled 'Unscathed'. \n In addition to a heavy regional schedule around Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, we put on a 5-6 day DIY charity festival every summer called Forward Fest. In 2017, our third year, we raised $1500 for A Voice for the Innocent, a Cincinnati-based non profit benefiting victims of sexual abuse.\n\nDirector Name: Cameron Gulley and Avanti\nFilmed by Jacob McClanahan\n\nAbout the Video: The song is about the division in our country, rich and poor, white and black, left and right. We wanted to visualize the way the mainstream media fans these flames.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/avantiohio\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/avantiohio\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/avantiohio\nBandCamp: http://www.avantiohio.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/avantiohio\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Divide\"\n\nGet back, are you black or white? Nobody seems to care about the things inside. This is by design, nobody sees beyond what they've been given to see. Bite me. Turn away your gaze. There are things much more important than the words I say. Fight me on a Facebook page, when you don't even know why you think that way. Divided we all fall down. We can't stand til we stand together. I'm fighting for my own, I can't bear this weight alone. Divided we all fall down, but no one wants to break the silence. If we could just come together, we could make this hell our home. Why, of all the demons of our days, do we choose to fight our battles over skin we cannot change? I would rather everyone go blind than have to suffer for the ignorance of pointless chosen sides. We cannot walk the path paved by the ones before us. We cannot walk the way or talk the way we did before. We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g2KPHSkzPrM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g2KPHSkzPrM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g2KPHSkzPrM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g2KPHSkzPrM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g2KPHSkzPrM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":175,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"g2KPHSkzPrM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/pTe0N0FcXLdwSQyoQd-ahhMr7P4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LndKdjNWMlhjMDlN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-06T20:42:19.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"60 Wrap$$ - \"Good Luvin'\" Golden Money Music Group","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - 60 Wrap$$ - \"Good Luvin'\" - Like this video?

The band is three parts vocals with Pepe Waitforit Poliquin as the lead singer and Mike Decker and Simon Savard performing double-duty on guitar and vocals, one part low-end bass crafted by Tommy Vaillancourt, and one hundred percent integrity. \n\nBornBroken is the sound of the beaten and the fallen overcoming their outlook of a blackened tomorrow through the medium of aggressive, galloping metal. Lyrically, the focus remains on taking sorrow and anger and rising up from the ashes to rebuild and heal a new world from one that’s crumbling down around us now. Lyrics have had a very personal connection for the band since their beginnings in 2008. Much of the band cut their teeth playing in local groups like Endast, Burn Unit, Resisting Arrest, Majester, Dilute the Poison and Mort au Combat.\n\nContrary to their raw, aggressive music they are incredibly passionate about  truth, integrity, perseverance, loyalty, and faith in humanity’s struggle for equality. Their debut album ‘The Healing Powers Of Hate’ appeared at #10 on the Earshot national loud charts in Canada in 2013 and the band is planning another heavy release for 2016..After months of writing and hours spent in the studio, BornBroken managed to take every emotion they felt, put it to music, build off of past battle scars, and create a record where listeners will feel they are part of the storyline. The band continues to create grinding, heavy music inspired by the likes of Hatebreed and Sepultura. Get ready to experience the monumental shift when the broken shall finally rise.\n\nDirector Name: Chris Kells\nDirector Link: http://www.ftbvisuals.com\n\nAbout the Video: The Years of Harsh Truths and Little Lies…\n\"This is a world of lies\" The title track to this release. We live in a time where reality is now a station on the internet and controlled by a select few in the 1%.  It's sad to say that we live in time where people are afraid to stand up and speak for themselves and most do not really care.  If we soon do not open up our eyes and see what is really happening around us , the world will turn around and bite back and we will not be prepared for it.\n\nArtist Website: https://www.brokenmusic.ca/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/bornbroken\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/bornbroken\nBandCamp: http://bornbroken.bandcamp.com/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8og5nHM-Ac/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8og5nHM-Ac/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8og5nHM-Ac/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8og5nHM-Ac/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8og5nHM-Ac/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":177,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"e8og5nHM-Ac"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/_JWPrU__QM7k_TisjtUBWDyiqSM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlBDd0hhQnRsZGRn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-05T01:34:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Harnessing the Universe - \"Beyond the Bright\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Harnessing the Universe - \"Beyond the Bright\" - Like this video?

Raised on 80’s punk with a side of maple syrup, Alberta native Dave Klym (The Mike Plume Band, The Populars, Itch) is the driving force behind the band’s monster hooks and blazing solos. On rhythm guitar, John Payne (Puppetbox) has been known to contribute harmonies as silky as his well-coiffed hair. Larry Mancini holds down the fort on the bass guitar with a little bit of whimsy, and a belly full of pizza. Anchoring this operation is drummer Matt Ernst, whose thunderous beats form the foundation for the group’s aggressive style.\nWith infectious melodies and gallows humor, The Tracys’ brand of pop punk holds true to the sensibilities of old-school West Coast punk. With the release of their third record, 'Humdinger', The Tracys continue to hone their signature sound, taking aim at what ails us with a double barreled blast of music and mayhem.\n\nDirector Name: Benoit Gabriel\nProducer Name: Benoit Gabriel\n\nAbout the Video: NYC punk rock outfit The Tracys put their individuality and humor on full-display, with their video for “I Hate Dancing”! The track comes off their full-length album 'Humdinger', released March 2018. The band said, \"We’re punk rock musicians; if we’re not violently bashing into each other, we’re standing in the back drinking. Dancing? Not so much. The “I Hate Dancing” video, our second project with director Benoit Gabriel, puts our sense of humor, and fun-loving nature on display. This video documents our futile efforts to learn some dance moves, and cements our legacy as the worst boy band in the world.”\n\nArtist Website: https://www.thetracysrock.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheTracys/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/@thetracysrock\nBandCamp: https://thetracys.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the_tracys/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/6IM7SRSuecs8g9rxYwbnIZ\n\nSong Lyrics: \"I Hate Dancing\"\n\nI hate dancing, I'm not the dancing type are \nyou?

Whilst growing up in Blackpool Lucas Fletcher and Tim Nelson formed a band called Insomnia, they mainly focused on playing covers but wanted to go further.  Eventually Insomnia came to an end. Lucas, still enthusiastic to create music of his own, soon got in contact with bass player and vocalist Mikey Jenkins who introduced Lucas to Becky Slater the drummer, This created a whole new feel to the band which soon took the name \"Avarus.\"  \nSince the four have been together they wrote and released two EP's, self titled and 'Limbo' the second EP. 'Limbo' really shows how they developed as a band and as their own musicians compared to the first 3-track EP which showed the very early stages of their presence as a band.  \nAfter the second studio e.p. 'Limbo' Guitarist Tim Nelson parted ways with the band due to personal reasons and Avarus quickly replaced him with a childhood friend of Mikey, Richard Jodrell, lead guitarist. Currently with a growing fan base on their e.p Limbo and the brand new record 'Hope Is All We've Got' with their young age and a different approach to metal music Avarus are making a massive impact on their home city and around the whole of the UK.\n\nMembers:\nLucas Fletcher on guitar and main vocals\nBecky Slater on drums\nMikey Jenkins on bass and vocals \nRichard Jodrell on lead guitar \n\nDirector Name: Bobby Pook\nProducer Name: Phil Gornell \n\nAbout the Video: The video was shot in a photography studio as we wanted a pitch black room, because we had some pretty big lights we wanted to use for a performance video. \n\nArtist Website: https://avarusofficial.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/avarusofficial/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/avarus_official\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/avarus_official/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3ZRXdgHJVTFIRGwH5MQF7U?si=pqtSDhUGS1ecrkv4uAF2HA\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Empire\"\n\nWhy the excuses when I know you’re wrong,\nThese thoughts that I’m having won’t leave me alone,\nI can’t escape I’m trapped again,\nThis empire you built is not condemned. \n \nI won’t hold back this time,\nHeavens calling but I’m stuck outside. \n \nI can see,\nhow you’re killing me.\nAnd now I can breathe,\nas you set me free. \n \nBurn, on the stake that I built for you,\nNow feel how I did,\nwhen abomination took you.\nThis world that we live in is to blind to see,\nThat were falling,\nAnd were going deep. \n \nWhat kind of God gets away with this?\nBroken hearts and all that shit,\nSorry my love but my souls not for sale,\nWe’re dying slowly,\nMost can’t even prevail. \n \nI can see,\nhow you’re killing me.\nAnd now I can breathe,\nas you set me free. \n \nHeavens calling me but I won’t answer,\nThe devils at my door but I can’t answer.\nTimes getting short,\nAnd this ship is sinking,\nI’ll take my power back,\nThis is my empire.\n \nI won’t hold back this time,\nHeavens calling but I’m stuck outside. \n \nI can see,\nhow you’re killing me.\nAnd now I can breathe,\nas you set me free. \n \nAm free. \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qgA5nyb9-zQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qgA5nyb9-zQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qgA5nyb9-zQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qgA5nyb9-zQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qgA5nyb9-zQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":183,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qgA5nyb9-zQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/8iXgCb4jqjrh3qEYpEdRIzlzhMU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkcwWmNRbW1nLS1N","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-03T20:07:33.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Shane Yansi - \"We Celebrate Life\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Shane Yansi - \"We Celebrate Life\" - Like this video?

Heavily rooted in the golden era, he’s managed to assimilate contemporary aesthetics to create catchy accessible music. “I grew up during the golden age of Hip-Hop,” he says. I had my two Technics 1200s, a Gemini mixer, a Pioneer receiver, and Cerwin-Vega speakers in my bedroom.” He released several songs years ago under a different moniker but was recently persuaded to pick the mic back up. “I'm influenced by rappers who are saying something lyrically worth remembering,” he notes, pointing to acts like KRS ONE, Rakim, Mos Def, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Kendrick Lamar, and J.

Chelsea Ray's intense, yet dream-like vocals can pierce as well as float over Be Hussey’s (GUIDES, Radar Bros.) thick wall of sonics, resulting in a noisy, aggressive, yet ethereal sound.\n\nDirector Name: Sarah Bitely\nProducer Name: Comp-ny\n\nAbout the Video: The first single from L.A. duo TANGIENTS was inspired by no less than a near-death experience. “In 2012, I underwent something traumatic that forever changed me … My heart stopped and I was shocked back to life,” singer Chelsea Ray says. “The sparse, yet intense memories I have from this moment gave me a completely different perspective. After ‘coming back,’ I felt that I was only a fragment of the person I was before. Here I am a few years later, writing lyrics about it, and I feel lucky just to be here.”\n“White Foam” — both the bleached-out video directed by Sarah Bitely featuring Ray and collaborator Be Hussey, as well as the song itself, a swirl of electronic post-punk haze — complete the powerful introduction to the duo.\" - Buzzbands.LA\n\nDirector of Photography: Lawrence Le \nEditors: Chelsea Ray, Be Hussey\n\nArtist Website: http://www.tangients.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tangients/\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/tangients\nBandCamp: https://tangients.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/tangients\n\nSong Lyrics: \"White Foam\"\n\nNew body of water\nConstant old\nDrips of stars\nJaded night\nYou're alright\nHot drips of stars\nWhite foam\nMoving currents\nA piece of you fills the air\nAnd you realize it's you that you are missing\nWhite foam\nMoving currents\nI knew what it was\nBecause I could imagine\nWhat it might be\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqNbI-SlhI4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqNbI-SlhI4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqNbI-SlhI4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqNbI-SlhI4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqNbI-SlhI4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":188,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qqNbI-SlhI4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/OJAVZclHDEL2YCzhemzsdgfx2T8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm9hUUxteGxuX2xB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-01T21:49:14.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Electrik Slim - \"Rolling Stoning\" Cool Future World","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Electrik Slim - \"Rolling Stoning\" - Like this video?

From the original nucleus, (material and news about myspace.com/nestband) are two founding members — Riccardo Dugini (vocals, guitar), and Luca Petrarchi (vocals, guitar); to complete the organic Massimiliano Zatini - already aggregated to Nest as percussionist in some acoustic and experiments here on bass - and Alessandro Pagani (former drummer in Subterraneans and one of the masterminds of Valvola/Shado Records), in training for a period in the mid-90 's when the group was called Malastrana. The band's name was inspired by the story of Ernst Lossa, jenish child killed in the 1944 by the Nazi as part of their program of extermination of individuals, narrated among the others by Marco Paolini in his show \"Ausmerzen\".\n\nDirector Name: Michele Faggi\nProducer Name: Kinodv\n\nAbout the Video:  \"Daydream\" is the new video clip (and single) of Stolen Apple from the 'Trenches' album, a song inspired by a poem written by Daniela Pagani, Florentine singer and poet, who died prematurely at the age of twenty-two.\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/Stolen.Apple.Band/ \nBandCamp:  https://stolenapple.bandcamp.com/  \n\nLabel Name: Rock Bottom Records\nLabel Website: http://www.rockbottom.it/modx/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Daydream\"\n \nI turned the road\nin the small town\ncontinuous noise\nnot leaving down\n \nA fountain leaks\nand tried to squeeze\nanother more\nthat stopped to pees\n \nWas happy\nI dream\nWas happy\nI dream\n \nSo I went back\nand leaks a bit\nI gazed at them\nand then I sit\n \nI put a plaid on me\nand falled asleep\nto dream the founts I see\nhad the closed lip\n \nWas happy\nI dream\nWas happy\nI dream\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYXOGZCu7Ts/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYXOGZCu7Ts/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYXOGZCu7Ts/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYXOGZCu7Ts/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYXOGZCu7Ts/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":194,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RYXOGZCu7Ts"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/nNJ7wZgH3sb0dkMwl8qXnMNhats\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjY2RGZrZFY2dUdZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-30T07:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Hub City Stompers - \"Hub City Stomp\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Hub City Stompers - \"Hub City Stomp\" - Like this video?

An exhausting search for band members for bass and vocals started and the line up changed many times. After hard working and multiple rehearsal rooms they released their first demo, including 3 tracks in 2013. One year later a split-tape with their friends in ZERRE with two new tracks was published. From then on (with the final and current line up) CP played various live shows and focused on their first full length album. In mid 2016 they entered the studio and on 27th of October 2017 they released their self-named full length album on 500 limited vinyl records in standard black and translucent blue via LakteTown Records. 12 tracks on around 25 minutes length.\n\nDirector Name: CRUCIAL POINT\nProducer Name: Hannes Greve \nProducer Link: http://www.hannesgreve.de/\n\nAbout the Video: \"WE ARE CRUCIAL POINT #1\" is the first part of a documentary about the Berlin based hardcore punk band CRUCIAL POINT.

The band (formerly known as just Slyde) will drop ten tracks of the intricate, contrapuntal prog rock they've honed over the last decade, on May 18 2018.\n\nIn true prog fashion, The Slyde stays true to their mission statement with their quirky arrangements, aggressive edge, and ominous lyrics. The result is a thought provoking, high-octane album for fans of Rush, Dream Theater, Haken, Coheed and Cambria, and Megadeth. Driven by Nathan Da Silva’s elegant vocals, Sarah Westbrook's powering keyboard skills, and the powerful rhythm section of Alberto Campuzano and Brendan Soares, the band are to catch the ears of any technically minded melodic prog rock fan. \n\nThe Slyde has played over 170 shows on the Eastern Canadian circuit, sharing the stage with such bands as Protest The Hero, Down With Webster, Pain of Salvation, Fuck The Facts, Dana Fuchs, and Timber Timbre among others, and have made appearances at Ottawa Bluesfest, Canadian Music Week, IndieWeek, and Wacken Metal Battle Canada.\n \nArtist Website: http://www.theslyde.ca/\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/theslydecanada\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/theslydecanada\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/theslydecanada\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvnaXVJRSYQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvnaXVJRSYQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvnaXVJRSYQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvnaXVJRSYQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvnaXVJRSYQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":202,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"wvnaXVJRSYQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Gl252q2f9HDVf8SdgPbkAGftFWY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnM2NWxtdTZ5Wldz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-29T23:42:18.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Amorla - \"Matches\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Amorla - \"Matches\" - Like this video?

Dopamine has always wanted to write catchy songs laden with riff-tastic hooks and gruff vocals! Influences range from royal blood, kings of leon and foo fighters to placebo, band of skulls, silversun pickups to nirvana. We never want to stick to one genre as ideally we want to write songs that almagamate heavy rock, indie and blues with a country twist in some songs. Dopamine has just finished their debut EP consisting of 4 tracks that show our influences. Our debut single \"Remedy\" has just been released and is a hard heavy rock song that has always got the listener dancing! Dopamine is 3 guys who are very serious about music but also and most importantly want to have fun and get people off their feet and go wild as first and foremost dopamine is a live band that gigs all over the uk and hope to progress in the future.\n\nDirector Name: Daniel Pitts\nProducer Name: Andy Hunt\n\nAbout the Video: Live video using a screen and colours to bring it to life.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DOPAMINEuk1/\nTwitter: @dopamineuk2\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Remedy\"\n\nYour a needle in the vein\nMorphine or poison your all the same\nwatching you walk away head down\nlay myself onto the ground\ni cant help seeing\nReminiscing of your face\neven the dead say\nyou ripped my heart out and you sat there watching and everyone screamed because they knew the feeling\nYour a train that accelarates\nA devil down but then regenerates\nYour a bullet in the brain\ni take it you dont feel the same now\ni cant help seeing reminiscing of your face\neven the dead say\nYou ripped my heart out and you sat there watching and everyone screamed because they knew the feeling\nEveryone takes a breath as i down the rest of my home made remedy\nEveryone takes a breath as i down the rest of my homemade remedy\nand im choking and im choking and im choking\nand everyone screamed because they knew the feeling\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDnX0xiXieY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDnX0xiXieY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDnX0xiXieY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDnX0xiXieY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDnX0xiXieY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":207,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jDnX0xiXieY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Wu2oRz3jsan6VZd5UBZ33p8GxOE\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LllfMEdoLUItZlJv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-28T01:13:46.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Outfit - \"Wire\" Pavement Entertainment - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Outfit - \"Wire\" - Like this video?

Chicago veteran musicians, brothers Mark and Matt Nawara, and Mike Gorman, along with Phoenix, Arizona’s, Andy Mitchell have formed The Outfit.\n\nThe Outfit brings you straight up rock and roll, with catchy hooks and an aggressive sound. The Nawara brothers played the Chicago club scene for years, along with writing and recording original music. Mike Gorman comes from two legendary Chicago bands, Pezband and Off Broadway. Rounding out the lineup is singer/songwriter and guitarist Andy Mitchell, whose past bands included Dish, Verona and 9 Volt.\n\nThe Outfit released their first self-titled album on February 2, 2018. It was engineered by Chicago music veteran Matt Mercado at Sonic Palace Studios in Oak Park, Illinois. Mixing was handled in Los Angeles by Grammy nominated, multi-platinum producer and mixer Ulrich Wild (Pantera, Static-X, White Zombie, Deftones, and Breaking Benjamin).\n\nDirector Name: Jonathan Broaker\nProducer Name: Polymyth Productions\n\nAbout The Video: \"Wire\" possesses a high-energy sound and goes all out with its riveting riffs, solid rhythms, and punchy vocals. The video showcases The Outfit performing in a warehouse, which successfully captures the spirit of pure, raw, unfiltered rock.\n\nUltimately, the band wants to bring the rock scene back to basics with an edge. \"Wire\" will surely follow the success of the album's lead single, \"Soldier Boy,\" which currently has over 16,000 streams on Spotify and has been receiving airplay all over Rock Radio stations. The single is currently number 45 on Mediabase's Active Rock Chart, closing in on a top 40 position.\n\nArtist Website: http://theoutfit.rocks/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheOutfitrock/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/theoutfitrock\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theoutfitrock/\n\nLabel Name: Pavement Entertainment\nLabel Website: https://www.pavementmusic.com/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Wire\"\n\nYeah!\nTake a picture, write it down\nAnd the rule is\nOn a wire, no control\nMaking room for your mouth, moves up and down\n\nFury found spaces, while everything traces the circles, you keep running around\nIn a fire, you get wiser\nFury found spaces, while everything traces the circles, you keep running around\nOn a wire, you get higher\n\nJumping fires, getting burned\nNot much room for\nSize you up, knock you down\nYou better saddle up before you get thrown around\n\nFury found spaces, while everything traces the circles, you keep running around\nIn a fire, you get wiser\nFury found spaces, while everything traces the circles, you keep running around\nOn a wire, take me higher than before\n\nThan before, than before\nI didn’t know\nThere’s a room inside my brain\n\nYeah!\n\nFury found spaces, while everything traces the circles, you keep running around\nIn a fire, you get wiser\nFury found spaces, while everything traces the circles, you keep running around\nOn a wire, take me higher than before\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y_0Gh-B-fRo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y_0Gh-B-fRo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y_0Gh-B-fRo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y_0Gh-B-fRo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y_0Gh-B-fRo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":208,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Y_0Gh-B-fRo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/plzyJ1ni2i-Kk0erNnIDfs6VNv0\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkZuMFFHZzZWdWFj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-26T00:47:18.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Laserchrist - \"Big Smoke City\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Laserchrist - \"Big Smoke City\" - Like this video?

They have released four full length albums and played concerts in venues and festivals. The band describes their music by a quote, written by the press, for one of their records: “…pure heavy metal can exist…”\n\nApart from live appearances and composing songs, little has happened until 2004, when they started working on their demo 'Senses of Dusk', which was finished in early 2005.\nTheir first album, 'The Witch’s Pact', became reality in 2006. It contained 10 metal dynamites and continues to give people a good head banging until this day. The album was self-released on a limited number of copies.\nIn 2008, they finished their second album entitled 'Hybris', which sounds like concrete cracking from an earthquake, driving the band’s sound into a heavier and more solid direction. 'Hybris' was released worldwide in November 2009.\nIn 2012 their third album was complete. Entitled 'The Devil Got His Soul', it is described by fans as a heavy metal statement. Compiled of ten songs, it unfolds track after track into a riff manifest!\nIn September 2013, After Dusk released a single called “Gamma Ray Burst”.

The line-up was completed by guitarist Mr. D aka “Dhilorz” (Ancient), drummer Alessandro Durini and vocalist Marco Piras (Deathtopia, Funeral Rape).\nIn the spring of 2012 the band played their first gig having the chance to support Death Metal legends ENTOMBED during their Italian show. A few months later GRIND ZERO played with Norwegian acts DISKORD and EXECRATION in addition to several more shows around Italy.\nIn April 2013 the band released a three-track promo titled “FORCEFUL DISPLACEMENT” and shortly after opened for the Italian gig of POSSESSED and MALIGNANT TUMOR. After some more shows in Italy and Switzerland, the band finally entered Alpha Omega studios to record their debut album titled “MASS DISTRACTION” which came into light in July 2014 through the Danish label MIGHTY MUSIC.\nIn April 2015 Matteo Amighetti replaced drummer Alessandro Durini and GRIND ZERO played various concerts with the new line-up, including a four-band mini tour around Italy, and performed at the 6th edition of Hellbrigade Festival\nsupporting INCANTATION and DEAD CONGREGATION.\nIn December 2016 Matteo Amighetti and GRIND ZERO parted ways. Emanuele Prandoni was welcomed behind the drumkit as a session.\nAt the beginning of 2017 GRIND ZERO started recording another three-track demo of crushing Death Metal with the infamous BOSS HM-2 sound and downtuned guitars.\nThe 10 tracks of the upcoming second album “CONCEALED IN THE SHADOW” were completed in spring 2017 and all the tracks were recorded by Alex Colombo at “Red Pigeon Studio” near Milan during the summer except for drums which were recorded in late July at “Ex Oblivion Studio” in Oristano - Sardegna.\nIn the last week of October 2017 GRIND ZERO had the chance to play live supporting Swedish Thrash/Death metal gods MERCILESS and Italian veterans NECRODEATH.\nThe mixing of the new album was completed by Alex and mastered by Dan Swanö in December 2017 and will be published on Punishment 18 Records.\n\nDirector Name: Grind Zero\nProducer Name: Grind Zero\n\nAbout the Video: Hello Metalheads!\nA video of the song \"MASTER'S PLEASURE\" is now available on YouTube.\nThis is the first one made for our upcoming new album \"CONCEALED IN THE SHADOW\" which will be released on May the 25th through Punishment 18 Records.\nThe inspiration for the video comes from '70s horror movies and actual crimes.

Despite forming in 2015, the band has been a project many years in the making. Band guitarist and producer Steven Kingo had a clear vision of the styles and themes he wished to convey as he set off to form the group. Over time he assembled members whilst working away on demos in the studio with guitarist Kristo Ülper and Drummer Joel Hainsalu. Steven wanted to bring his own blend of new wave progressive metal to Estonia, drawing inspiration from bands such as Periphery, Tesseract, Intervals and even Meshuggah.\n\nThe name Inter Omega has been a concept existing right from the project’s inception. ‘Inter’, to mean buried and between, in this instance representing ‘within one’s self’. And ‘Omega’, (Literally meaning ‘Great O’) signifies greatness, but also as the last letter of the Greek alphabet, denotes limitation and represents the ultimate end of a set. Combining these two words conveys the idea that we all have potential within ourselves, and the only thing stopping us is our own minds. This is a theme that is channelled through the lyrics, written respectively by each vocalist Ben Roomes and Mathias-Erik Tempel.\n\nInter Omega released its first single ‘Pieces’ in the summer of 2016, followed by second single ‘Bitter Suite’ at the very end of the year. The Bitter Suite single marked the band’s debut music video, shot and directed by guitarist Kristo Ülper. The band’s third single 'Ascendant' followed with another self-produced video in August 2017. ‘Resilience’ is the latest offer from the five-piece, this time reaching out to Martin Kaljuorg as a director for the video to create a darker and more concept orientated theme.\n\nTo date, the band are currently tucked away in the studio working on a full-length album with more releases planned for the future.\n\nDirector Name: Martin Kaljuorg\nProducer Name: Martin Kaljuorg\n\nAbout the Video: \"Resilience\" is the fourth single by Estonian progressive metal band Inter Omega\nMusic video directed and edited by Martin Kaljuorg Visuals https://bit.ly/2EGBvQZ\nIntro monologue taken from 'How to Find the Real You' a lecture from Alan Watts\nSpecial thanks to Piibe Pajur, Maido Möls, Athena keskus and Sound Group OÜ\nSong written and performed by Inter Omega\nProduced, mixed and mastered by Steven Kingo\nVocals and lyrics: Ben Roomes and Mathias-Erik Tempel\nGuitars: Steven Kingo and Kristo Ülper\nDrums: Joel Hainsalu\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/interomegaband/\nBandCamp: https://interomega.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/interomegaband/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Resilience\"\n\nOh, I am so tired\nOf hitting these walls, just to hold on\nTo an idea of something so far out of reach\nWhat was I thinking?\nPlaying myself, creating illusions\nI thought it would end the other way around\n\nLeft me with questions without an answer\nRecalling memories from afar\nTake a step back and find some time\nLiving to satisfy\n\nLeaving negative thoughts behind\nMake a change to feel some pride\nLiving life like I want to live\nFacing myself to level up\naway from the state of no future\n\nIf you could read the writing\nand sing through the silence\nYou will fight the shadows\nYour passion gives you guidance\nEmbrace the life around you\nResilience and virtue\nAs you keep on fighting\nyou feel the dark subsiding\n\nEach and every day you turn around\nyour passion keeping your feet firmly on the ground\nTake it from a man who’s questioning his pride\nI could hear my calling from this place inside\n\nI might have fallen behind\nBut here I go again\nCorners to cut, first in the line\nFound nothing to gain but just wasting time\n\nI am the mastermind\nAnd we are the people\nRunning away from you\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6717gGdUUuU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6717gGdUUuU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6717gGdUUuU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6717gGdUUuU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6717gGdUUuU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":214,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6717gGdUUuU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/5BX8QuYv7bRbZihdQ1sbeG25MGM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lkp2SlotMC1la00w","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-24T21:30:07.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Target Earth - \"Manipulator\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Target Earth - \"Manipulator\" - Like this video?

KrankTV.com!\n \n***\nDormanth - \"Like Ice\" Dead Sheep / Base Record / Necromance\n\nArtist city, country: Bilbao, Spain\n\nArtist Bio: DORMANTH was born in Bilbao in January of 1993 after several experiences of its components in different bands like NOPRESION (Oscar del Val), BEER MOSH (Javi Martínez) or ELBERETH (Maciej Zienkiewicz).\nAfter consolidating their formation with Jorge Elizalde (Bass & Vocals) and Santi G. Mendezona (guitar) they recorded their self-produced demo \"SADNESS\" in January of 1994, selling all the copies and opening several doors, demonstrating their value directly by the Iberian Peninsula.\nA year later they decided to make the jump and record their CD \"VALLEY OF DREAMS\" securing them as one of the groups with more projection within the national extreme metal scene.\nAfter a season doing concerts, problems arise in the bosom of the group getting to change their drummer.\nThree of its components (Jorge, Santi and Oscar) decide to continue playing. In 1996 the group ceased its activity, resuming it in 2015.\nThat year an EP \"VOICE OF THE SOUL ...\" was recorded as an anniversary gift for fans of the band who still ask for their return to the stage.\nIn 2016 recorded their CD “WINTER COMES” released through BASE RECORDS PRODUCTIONS, a true melodic old school death-doom return, with Oscar del Val (guitars and vocals) in front of a new line up, experienced musicians such as Javi Prieto and Victor Franquelo (Both from Spanish band MORDOR) joined their efforts to complete the lineup. \nOn March 2017, DEAD SHEEP PRODUCTIONS released a compilation album called “Valley of Sadness”, including the old recordings from 1994 to 2015.\nOn March 2018, their third album will be released under the monicker “IX Sins”, BASE RECORDS PRODUCTIONS, DEAD SHEEP PRODUCTIONS and NECROMANCE RECORDS will be the labels that release this new full length. No lineup changes from the last release, except the addition of Miguel A. Richart for the bass duties. Igor Muguerza is again the artist chosen for the art concept, such as in their previous releases. \n2018 will be also the return to the stages and live performances, Oscar del Val (vocals & guitars), Miguel A. Richart (guitars now), Isma Fernández (bass), will complete the lineup with original drummer Javi Martínez.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dormanthoficial\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/dormanthband\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dormanth/\nContact: dormanthoficial@gmail.com\n\nLabel Name: Dead Sheep Productions, Base Record Production and Necromance Records\nLabel Website: http://www.deadsheepproductions.es/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7A4_VF86sfI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7A4_VF86sfI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7A4_VF86sfI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7A4_VF86sfI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7A4_VF86sfI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":216,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"7A4_VF86sfI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/wlAX6_68J_CaD4wPzSBTtflOZ0c\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Llh0Q290VnowUWVV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-24T20:18:57.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Drug Free Collective - \"Football Is Sex\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Drug Free Collective - \"Football Is Sex\" - Like this video?

Their music aligns most closely with black metal, though they incorporate aspects of death, doom, and the avant-garde. Voidthrone’s debut album, 'Spiritual War Tactics', was released October 31, 2016. Between releases, the band, comprising of Josh and Ron welcomed Mac, their second guitarist. Shortly thereafter, they took on a new singer, Zhenya, whose beyond-the-veil psychedelic presence and intense live performance have taken Voidthrone to new places. \n\nVideo Creator: Joshua Smith @ GreyLane Media (greylanemedia@outlook.com)\n\nAbout the Video: The video is a collaboration between GreyLane Media and Voidthone. A sense of confusion and foreboding is cultivated by a lack of narrative and thematic repetition. Deliberate separation from conventions parallels the emotionally exhausting musical style.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/voidthrone\nBandcamp: https://voidthrone.bandcamp.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/voidthroneband\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5bm3oUxXAkt7_kcj79VuHA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/voidthronemetal/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2YWKCOQngEw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2YWKCOQngEw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2YWKCOQngEw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2YWKCOQngEw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2YWKCOQngEw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":224,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2YWKCOQngEw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/annAaA1mV43pAn1U65Mn6p3PwdQ\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnNHbzJmSllsaUxV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-21T20:26:55.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Finnegan's Hell - \"Shane MacGowan's Grave\" Heptown Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Finnegan's Hell - \"Shane MacGowan's Grave\" - Like this video?

The hit single \"The Molly Maguires\" put the band on the European Celtic punk map in 2011, and The Irish Times wrote: \"They’re hard to describe, but just imagine a blend of Metallica and the Kilfenora céilí Band and you’d be about right.\" \n\nIn 2014 Finnegan's Hell released a full-length album through Heptown Records, Europe's leading Celtic punk label. The album \"Drunk, Sick and Blue\" was well-received by the European music press, and earned the band gigs at some of Europe's biggest festivals and a publishing deal with Sound Pollution Songs.\n\nFinnegan's Hell has just released the album \"Life and Death\". The songs on the new album are musically diverse, but they share the lyrical themes of life and death, taking the listener on a roller coaster ride from the cradle to the grave. When recording \"Life and Death\" measures were taken to preserve the raw energy from a live performance, and the result is a record which takes no prisoners. \n\nDirector Name: Michael Ek\nProducer Name: Michael Ek\n\nAbout the Video: The video is a tribute to the uncompromising lifestyle of Shane MacGowan, frontman of The Pogues.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.finneganshell.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/finneganshell/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/finneganshell\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/finneganshell/\n\nLabel Name: Heptown Records\nLabel Website: http://www.hepcat.se\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Shane MacGowan's Grave\"\n\nI know I’ve been bad baby\nI know I’ve done you wrong\nI’ve been a disappointment\nFor so goddamn long\nI know I’ve spent our money\nOn whiskey, gin and beer\nBut baby, don’t you cry\nNo, save up all your tears \n\nI swear on Shane MacGowan’s grave\nI’ll never drink no more\nyou might shake your head in disbelief\nYou’ve heard it all before\n\nLife’s a rocky road\nWith temptation round every bend \nI’ve done my best to stay on track\nBut I derail in the end\nI know you’re sick and tired\nOf cleaning up my mess\nBut that’s all in the past, babe\nI’ll cause no more distress\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGo2fJYliLU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGo2fJYliLU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGo2fJYliLU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGo2fJYliLU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGo2fJYliLU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":225,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sGo2fJYliLU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/c_rXr1k2EvideqcnUGRUeTsEiMo\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Ll9rYVRPODZwdlRV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-20T02:14:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Palatines - \"Mina Doesn't Know\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Palatines - \"Mina Doesn't Know\" - Like this video?

The Palatines exploded onto the McAllen, Texas, scene with a hard driving, hooky, melodic flavor of punk with the likes of The Riverdales, The Creeps, Cocksparrer and Chuck Berry serving as major influences. \nIn April of 2016, Richard Casas (former bassist and frontman of punk band Baseborn) teamed up with Javi Luna to write the band's initial songs. By that May drummer Jeff Antons joined to complete the group. The boys played their first show that July opening up for Piñata Protest and independently released their first EP on CD entitled 'Never Made It' a month later.  \nSince then The Palatines have shared the stage with bands like Night Birds, Nekromantix, Lillingtons, Teenage Bottlerocket, Wonk Unit and The Queers to name a few.  2018 saw another d.i.y. release of their debut 15-song full length album 'Death from Below' on vinyl and CD.\n\nDirector Name: Javier Luna and Jeff Antons\nProducer Name: The Palatines\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thepalatinestx\nBandCamp: https://thepalatines.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: @thepalatinestx\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Mina Doesn't Know\"\n\nShe dreams of a time \nof a time so long ago \nhaunted by a face that she dont know \n\nAccepting his affairs \nhis affairs with fate unknown \npossesed in many ways \nletting go \n\n(what) Mina doesnt know \nshe'll fade into the darkness \nshe'll fade into the darkness \n\nFacing a moral bind \nshes fighting toe to toe \ngive up the chase \nlet her go \n\nWith a lover left behind \nwith nothing left to show \ngive up the chase \nlet her go\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kaTO86pvTU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kaTO86pvTU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kaTO86pvTU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kaTO86pvTU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kaTO86pvTU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":226,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_kaTO86pvTU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/CzgzVMMaaNuNFH3cCotBQNnn8xc\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmlieFZXRzBrSzA4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-20T02:41:03.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Flo and Behold - \"Thrive\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Flo and Behold - \"Thrive\" - Like this video?

And it’s the games that you want to play, shame it on me But at the end of the day, I can only blame myself And all of the torture that I’ve had to deal I wasn’t anything, or anyone Cuz I’ve tried my best to play the part And all I can do was just fake it for so long But when they tried to tear me apart I can’t blame anything, or anyone at all I can’t blame anyone at all (x4)\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ral30N_uEJE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ral30N_uEJE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ral30N_uEJE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ral30N_uEJE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ral30N_uEJE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":228,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Ral30N_uEJE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/19JxcdT5DAmnAppb9UExErOSaY0\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnoyS0YwMFdteW9R","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-20T01:35:44.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Reifer Madness - \"Punk Rock Is Life\" MxSxA - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Reifer Madness - \"Punk Rock Is Life\" - Like this video?

His honest lyrics stick a middle finger up to today's society. With gigs across his hometown in venues such as Nambucca, The Monarch and The Half Moon, this rising star is already gathering quite a following. \nEliot released his debut single 'We Always Sail at Night' through MadMan Records in late 2017. It received wide coverage being played on Radio Stations such as RKC, FreshNet and 365. His follow up single ’Weak’ showed a darker side to his music and fans eagerly anticipated the release of his double EP ‘One Step Away From Madness.\nEliot dropped the first part of his debut EP ‘One Step Away’ on the 23rd February 2018 and begun working with HotVox, Blank TV and BBC Introducing. 'It’s a big shame that we would never be allowed to play “It’s The Weekend” on BBC Radio in its present form, but fair play to Eliot for not playing the corporate game.

Hailing from Southern California with band members that were too young to care, busy with other groups or lacked a desire to stay, the band lay mostly dormant for two years. Since then they’ve worked to become a staple in the San Diego punk and Chula Vista hardcore scene. Since recording the 'Someone to Watch Over Me' EP, They’ve brought their 80’s influenced brand of hardcore to the stage along side such acts as Bane, Miles Away, Defeater, Dead End Path and Rotting Out. Remain in Vain stands to become a force for Southern California’s hardcore scene to reckon with. \n\nDirector Name: R.i.V.\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/RemainInVain/ \nBandCamp: https://remaininvain.bandcamp.com/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ZbnEPACHEEyxdW9u0fXaB\n\nLabel Name: Safe Inside Records\nLabel Website: http://www.safeinsiderecords.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Plant Knowledge\"\n\n I wish, I wish I knew you back then you're not the person I've been hearing about don't hold it against me for thinking that you changed it's just hard to paint a picture in my mind of all the hell you raised.\nOh I pray the stories are true it's just how I wanted to picture you\nBut now I can't you've lost your edge don't take it personally it's just too bad ignorance is your way of expressing maturity\nI just need the hope. \n I just need to believe. \n you were once like me \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OUf7uXEfUzE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OUf7uXEfUzE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OUf7uXEfUzE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OUf7uXEfUzE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OUf7uXEfUzE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":231,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"OUf7uXEfUzE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/D1-KbRn570W6EHXstVg9eTzhilM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnY0S0tVbHhFbFJZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-16T17:33:03.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Talrak - \"Uncomfortable Happiness\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Talrak - \"Uncomfortable Happiness\" - Like this video?

Formed in 2016 by Dave Bourke and Mike Carroll who had been writing and recording an album to bring to potential members. The album became known as ‘Beyond the Glass’ and was the debut XERO album.\nBourke and Carroll decided every track should come from differing influences which would range from soft rock to hardcore and thrash metal, and everything in between.\nThey felt the worst thing that could happen was to be placed into a certain category which the band would then have to adhere to stylistically. The album had a large variety of sounds and pulls influence  from bands ranging from Pantera to Faith No more, Metallica to HIM, Black Sabbath to Oasis.\nCarroll and Bourke found common musical ground with drummer Andrew Farrell, bassist Nick Bromfield, keyboard player Peter Meehan and lead guitarist Conny O’ Connor and began jamming the songs which gave them quite a long set from the beginning putting them ahead of a lot of other bands in the local scene who were releasing EPs at the time.\nOver the last two years the band has worked hard refining their sound and tightness with one another and has written and recorded their first release featuring the writing influences of all band members, ‘SPITE’. SPITE is a 3-track EP showcasing a more evolved sound.\nDuring the writing and recording of the EP the band crossed paths with metal giant Jeff Waters of the legendary Canadian thrash metal band Annihilator who collaborated on the release bringing his writing style and lead guitar skills to the table further driving the sound into a much more professional sounding territory.\nEvery song on the band’s new batch of material is inspired by the mood and atmosphere of different horror movies of the 1960’s. Every song is different to the last but they all share a common dark and aggressive edge which unifies the tracks.\nSPITE was released in March of 2018.\nIn April of 2018 keyboard player Peter Meehan left the band and XERO now operates as a 5 piece. They are currently in the studio recording another 3 track collaboration EP with Florida based musician Shawn Bowen of Neurotica and Meatspace. The EP will be released under the name ‘Barriers’ at a later date this year.\n\nDirector Name:  Niall Coley\nProducer Name: XERO\n\nAbout the Video: Official music video for XERO's new song 'Savior' feat.

Tearing off the surface layer, I can taste your sickness, Shredded on the anger spike, Nothing matters anymore, Nothing matters anymore, No more, Pushing it deeper inside, they brought you closer to God, Fighting and grinding and pushing your way into the masses applause, Dragging the needle under the skin, retaliation wrapped in a prayer, Holding your cards close to your chest you are nobody's savior. Expose the vile behind the veil, To see disease in your eyes, I paint this picture with the blood you shed, I'll pull you out of your disguise, you are the dread, You are the dread, Expose the vile behind the veil, To see disease in your eyes, I paint this picture with the blood you shed, I'll pull you out of your disguise, you are the dread. Tearing off the surface layer, I can taste your sickness, Shredded on the anger spike, Nothing matters anymore, No more, Nothing matters anymore, No more, \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bJ77L1NxibA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bJ77L1NxibA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bJ77L1NxibA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bJ77L1NxibA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bJ77L1NxibA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":233,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"bJ77L1NxibA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/0db2FbStk6x_ga2ZaRpPOainUBk\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlVhLVpWOHoyZ01V","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-19T22:07:37.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Decatur - \"Worst Enemy\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Decatur - \"Worst Enemy\" - Like this video?

Each played guitar, with Moses taking the lead vocal role as well. This incarnation jammed garages and practice spaces for a year and a half before finally settling on a bassist and drummer, playing their first show in July of 2011.\nThe years that followed featured a revolving door of musicians and dozens of local shows. Blank Side has released four EP's since 2012, the last two releases consisting of their current members. In recent years, the band has traveled to play various south Texas cities, as well as opening locally for bands like The Queers and The Freeze.\nThe band’s sound started off as if conflicted, split down the middle between straight forward hardcore punk reminiscent of earl 80's acts like The Germs or Jerry's Kids, with the other half of their tunes clearly influenced by the more melodic 90's wave of pop punk. By the time the 'Etheric' EP was released, they had taken a turn in the direction of powerviolence, now including more blast beats and breakdowns in their musical toolbox. With their latest singles, including \"Ringworm\", the band aspires to combine both, their brutal and melodic sides, often taking the listener on a journey across nearly their entire spectrum of influences in under three minutes.\n\nDirector Name: D'ante Speed\nProducer Name: D'ante Speed of Machspeed Productions & Videography (@machspeed365) & \"Eli9T7\"\n\nAbout the Video: This video was shot at a local show in San Antonio at a DIY art gallery.

Then waking up and realising you are in a band and you are on stage and you may have soiled yourself. That's kind of a bit like what we sound like but faster and with more guitars, drums and melodic harmonies.\n \nDirector Name: Mike Higgo\nProducer Name: Bogans/Mike Higgo\n\nAbout The Video: \"Dumbskulls drags you immediately in at 100mph with driving drums and spotlight moment for a rumbling bass.

According to the band, ‘Who We Are’ name speaks on its own. No matter what you do, or have done, what you say, or how you look like, the only thing that really matters is who you are right now. We are not saying that we discovered some philosophical revelation.\nThis song is about the second, the moment, the feeling that really matters and you realize that the moment you hear the single. This song is a story about one simple idea. This is a story about how we find our own path and realize ‘Who We Are’. The single is OUT NOW! In addition to that the band also promises to release another official music video soon!\n\nArtist Website: http://www.weespofficial.com/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/weespband\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BANDWEESP\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/weespband\nBandCamp: https://weesp.bandcamp.com/album/black-sails\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/weespband/\nVK: https://vk.com/weespband\n\nLabel Name: Zeppelin Records\nLabel Website: https://www.facebook.com/zeppelinrecordsby/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Who We Are\"\n\nWe tasted death\nWe drank up life\nWe fell in love once\n\nTime ran through our hands\nStumbling over\nA wandering dog\nWe seem so alike\nWhat have we become\n\nSpill more acid over fresh minds\nErase, restart\nAnd dive into the light\nBecoming real\n\nWe're staring at the sun\nWe are who we are\nWe're just staring at the sun\nForever who we are\n\nWe drank up life\nWe haven't got wise\nConsumed emptiness\nFilled ourselves with it\n\nI can remember myself before\nEager to feel, to touch everything\nAs if life was on the end of my fingertips\nThis endless hustle, a rat run\nTrying to seem like somebody else,\nTrying do something that will be appreciated\nAs if it actually matters\nAfter all, the only thing important\nIs who you are\nAnd that's it\nBeing somebody\nI think it's the only way to be really free.\nFor me, it's just being\nThe one who is\nStaring at the sun\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tNpvT-UrDk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tNpvT-UrDk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tNpvT-UrDk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tNpvT-UrDk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tNpvT-UrDk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":240,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"0tNpvT-UrDk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/lUAbfErxx9fXmiYISgVwheFEpdA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjVKTXVyOHRfdXg4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-15T19:19:30.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Widow's Peak - \"CBT\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Widow's Peak - \"CBT\" - Like this video?

We are a 3-piece band that is Sid, Blake, and Grant. Heart to Gold put out an EP called 'Still Stuck' in April of 2016, with past members Jack Anderson and Michael Heimendinger.  The EP was followed by a string of demos due to a few medical procedures that made the band's future uncertain. Since the EP’s release and numerous local shows and touring, the music has gained some local attention for our intense live shows and our community-based crowds. We’ve played some very unbelievable shows and have been extremely fortunate in the short period our band has been active.

Their line up consists of Gunnar Sorgeloos, the vocalist, on the lead guitar Maarten Doumen, rhythm guitar Sander Meirezonne, on the bass/backings Dylan Minnebo and behind the drums Niels Wouters. \nIn the beginning of their journey the band released demo mixes such as 'Amongst Gods', 'Anywhere But Here', 'Silence Settles' and 'Downfall'. Their new official single was released in April 2018 called 'House of Cards' which can be described as a variety of grunts mixed with cleans, lined out with catchy riffs and solos. \nBefore the band formed every member came from different musical backgrounds but with the same passion for music: to express, to create and to grow not only as musicians or as people, but as a whole. \n\nDirector Name: Doumen Maarten\nProducer Name: Roox Ruben\n\nAbout the Video: Artwork made by Jens Francois\n\nArtist Website: http://vi.be/sixofive\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sixofiveofficial/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/605official\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/sixofiveofficial\nBandCamp: https://sixofive.bandcamp.com/album/house-of-cards-single-2018\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sixofiveofficial/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/58SgZL5mmt4yNoNLV5dqqU\n\nLabel Name: Lakehouse Studios\nLabel Website: https://www.facebook.com/lakehousestudio3110/\n\nSong Lyrics:\nWe drive far away to feel \nfree To escape is all we need \nIf the puzzle fits \nWhy change my destiny? \nTo this day I am far too hopeful \nTo this day I am way too patient \nTo this day I am far too hopeful \nShould I stay or just get wasted? \nAlways been stubborn \nIn the depths of every nerve \nYou and me both – (you and me both) \nWe knew things would change \nOur eyes behold the future \nStill we act surprised \nStill we act surprised \nWill I ever get to feel heaven again? \nStill we act surprised \nWill I ever get to feel heaven again? \nLooking for the click to start this machine \nI'm not misleading, or am I? \nWill I ever get to feel heaven again? \nStill we act surprised \nCan't we agree to disagree? \nJust go your own way \nMaybe I will see you there, or never again \nWe'll see what morning brings \nWhen we wake up to start again \nSometimes all it takes is a reason to start again (solo) \nIt's not what I did, it's what I do now \nIt's not what I did, it's what I do now \nTo this day I am far too hopeful \nTo this day I am way too patient \nTo this day I am far too hopeful \nShould I stay or just get wasted? \nLooking for the click to start this machine \nI'm not misleading, or am I? \nWill I ever get to feel heaven again?\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WL39Ul-OmIg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WL39Ul-OmIg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WL39Ul-OmIg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WL39Ul-OmIg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WL39Ul-OmIg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":256,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"WL39Ul-OmIg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Hlbvyr0264skNbs2FaB_8Ceu1QA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmRxandqWFFnenVz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-11T21:14:24.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Vet Hut - \"Lyssna inte på nåt jävla skit\" Heptown Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Vet Hut - \"Lyssna inte på nåt jävla skit\" - Like this video?

The footage used is from the noir classic, The Hitch-Hiker (1953).\nDirector: Ida Lupino\nProduced by: Ida Lupino & Collier Young\nAn RKO Radio Picture \nCast : Edmond O´Brien, Frank Lovejoy, William Talman \nThe video has been edited by Bo Andersen. \nThe footage is PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mofosteel/\nYouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEC_O_FQZBA\n\nLabel Name: Bad Clam Productions\nLabel Website: \n\nSong Lyrics: \"Pilgrim\"\n \nPilgrim stuck in the Traffic\nOh why did you kill him\nIt´s right down tragic\n \nMoney, trust and lust\nI´m stuck in a jam \nWith The Big Freeze\nAnd Mister Just\n \nPulled up in a pickup truck\nYou can tell I´m ready to roll\nStill dress like a highschool jock\nI´m cool but my truck´s too old\n \nSee my girl down on the corner\nSweet as southern belle\nOh no I´m ten minutes late\nI bet she´s mad as hell\nShe´s a bonafied beauty queen\nI Just got out on bail\nShe knows I´m a part time lover\nI´m in love with her big black tail\n \nGet in and boogie\nNow baby baby\n I just left this cowboy\nHogtied with his lasso\n Guess he wasn´t ready for the real mccoy\nhe´s burried in El Paso\n \nPilgrim stuck in the Traffic\nOh why did you kill him\nIt´s right down tragic\nSheriff Marvin can´t be trusted\nOh why don´t you care if your ass\nIs busted in the street\nLord I´m praying for ya \nHow can you afford that big shot lawyer\nReverend Hill won´t bring you cover\nOh is this the end for a part time lover\n \nOh no Hobo – tracked by the state police\nI need a new date – I´m down on my knees\nAbout that cowboy – burried in El Paso\nYou know killin´ never brought me joy\n´cause I´m a lover like Picasso\n \nMoonshine liquor got me fast on the trigger\nslow on the banjo\nI´m a hobo kicker – a motown digger\nlike Elvis in the ghetto\n \nWent down to collect his bill\nHe was going for a gun at the wheel\nHe was a no good snitch in a pimp mobile\nAnd he died by my mofosteel\nStill stuck in a traffic jam \nI wanna screw but the girl said no\nGot a gun got a car but i won´t get far \nlike Elvis in the ghetto\n \nPilgrim stuck in the Traffic\nOh why did you kill him\nIt´s right down tragic\nSheriff Marvin can´t be trusted\nOh why don´t you care if your ass\nIs busted in the street\nLord I´m praying for ´ya \nHow can you afford that big shot lawyer\nReverend Hill won´t bring you cover\nOh is this the end for a part time lover\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_X55bD-0Os/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_X55bD-0Os/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_X55bD-0Os/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_X55bD-0Os/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_X55bD-0Os/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":259,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"u_X55bD-0Os"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/9XpQhCfBOC0ZqdeI1MyaUocV4ts\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnVCeUNoZDRHM2hj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-09T21:41:43.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Hollow Child - \"Shadows\" Official Live Video - 2018","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Hollow Child - \"Shadows\" - Like this video?

Lost souls, banished from paradise. \nAt the foot of bed, down the hall, visions of strange figures harass their lives. \nThe ethereal specter of death haunts their souls. \nNight brings terror... which the light ends. \nA stare awakens their most horrible dreams. \nUnder the moonlight, over the cemetery. \nWhere the entities get lost, whispering in the dawning. \nSurrounded by a funeral cold wind. \nThe vacuum of its eyes paralyzes their bodies, \nthe most dismal winter is born in their hearts. \nForgotten fears raise before the unknown. \nImpotence in the face of the incomprehensible is beyond us. \nAcross a long tunnel, towards the brightness of a new dimension. \nLaments lie hidden between crumbling walls. \nPsychic vestiges of the past bring... \nthe demons of our ancestors back again making us doubt of our human condition.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UmgWwFTAJLE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UmgWwFTAJLE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UmgWwFTAJLE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UmgWwFTAJLE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UmgWwFTAJLE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":264,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"UmgWwFTAJLE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/BH_hBYzfkw3bh4IicoYsLFi6YtM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjJCZnpPc2VVTGhv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-08T21:59:17.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Mormegil - \"Metamorphosis\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Mormegil - \"Metamorphosis\" - Like this video?

Comprising a quintet of expatriate members -- vocalist Dima (Russia), drummer Tyler (Canada), guitarists Larry (Scotland) and Martin (Denmark), and bassist Ian (Canada) -- SYG were formed in 2012. \nOver the years, contending with eleven separate members moving in and out of the country, as well as pressure from capricious government regulations, they experienced a flurry of roster changes. The band’s first live show was in April 2012, with a pair of live EPs released independently before 2014 when they issued the five-track 'Slip and Fall' EP. Featuring a bloody delivery reminiscent of Fucked Up, Every Time I Die, and Cancer Bats, 'Slip and Fall' was quickly followed by the one-off single “Poisoned Minds” later that summer. \nA split 7” with Russian hardcore brethren Broken Fist dropped in January 2015. As SYG continued to tour in mainland China, they found their way to sweaty stages in Singapore, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur. In the summer of 2016, they released their follow-up EP, 'Full Blast', with country wide shows and festival appearances. 2017 saw SYG’s first full-length debut, 'Hungry Crows', followed by a small China tour and a 5,000+ km tour across Russia.\n\nDirector Name: Laura Imkamp\nDirector Link: https://vimeo.com/lauraimkamp\n\nAbout the Video: Official video for the song 'Get Impaled' by SPILL YOUR GUTS (Shanghai, China), shot while on tour in Russia in October 2017. Featuring the trans-siberian railway experience, vodka, anti-Putin protests, underground bedroom wrestling, insane mosh pits, Russian bath houses and blast beats!\n\nChinese music streaming sites:\nQQ Music: https://goo.gl/J742Ua\n虾米 (Xiami): https://goo.gl/ZF9oDV\n网易云: https://goo.gl/KoA5Ba\n\nSYG on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/spillyourgutsband\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/spillyourgutsband\nYoutube: https://goo.gl/x4dqiN\n豆瓣: https://site.douban.com/spillyourguts/\nWeibo: https://weibo.com/spillyourguts\nVK: https://vk.com/spillyourguts21\n\nSong Lyrics:  \"Get Impaled\"\n\nDon’t like the color of my skin? \nGet impaled \nNot true enough to play your gig? \nGet impaled \n\nDon’t like who I have chosen to love? \nJudging for praising not your god? \nMarching with straightened arm in air? \nGo back to your medieval lair! \n\nGet impaled \nShip sailed \nGet impaled \nYou failed \n\nSome people pray, some masturbate \nSome search for answers, some debate \nSome get stoned some throw rocks \nWhile some are tired from you folks! \n\nSome fall some stand up \nSome give some pick up \nSome really never understand \nWhy we live this way at our own gate \n\nGet impaled \n\nFeeling the urge to disapprove \nHow I am spending my own time \nYou think you know how to improve \nI think you need to get impaled \n\nJudging for the beliefs I’ve got \nDenounce lack of faith in god \nForcing to follow beaten path \nYou are the shunned and the despised \n\nWith all problems in the world \nYou fucks decided to bring more \nBy judging others not like you \nAnd segregating different views \n\nTime for exiles to rise up \nDeclare war on hypocrites \nNow inquisitors turn to hide \nWitches are starting their own hunt\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBETsYtb8fk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBETsYtb8fk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBETsYtb8fk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBETsYtb8fk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBETsYtb8fk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":266,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SBETsYtb8fk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/hBDxcCshcUiz4GXG9R36uniadZQ\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Ljlka1FzZ0ctYWFr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-06T00:49:25.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Da Labrador - \"Wit Me\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Da Labrador - \"Wit Me\" - Like this video?

Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam and Nirvana), and on the other one it goes more toward the Post Rock atmosphere.\n\nAfter a strong live activity throughout Italy, including shows with Arcane Roots, Il Teatro Degli Orrori, L7, The Quireboys and Sham 69, the band has just finished working on first full-length album “Bloop” which will be published on November 7th 2016 in collaboration with K2 Music.\n\nThe sound that you’ll find in their new album is the exactly one that actually identifies the Acid Muffin: majestic and theatrical, a middle path between the surreal sound of Post Rock and the brainy music of Alternative Rock, absolutely modern and innovative.\n\nAcid Muffin is: Marco Pasqualucci - Guitar & Vocals; Grabiel Alvarez - Bass & Backing Vocals; Andrea Latini - Drums\n\nAdditional Musicians: Angelo Pelini - Grand Piano; Layer Bows - Violins, Viola & Cello\n\nDirector: Vincenzo Tafuri\nProducer: Timeless Production\nPhotography: Federico Spirito\nCamera Operator: Marco Alini\n1°Assistant Operator: Lorenzo Nuccio\nDrone Operator: Sandro Russello\nSteady-Man: Vincenzo Tafuri\nSet Dresser/Decorator: Alessia Marone\nMakeup Artist: Arianna Sammassimo\nStill Photographer: David Fricano\nEditor: Vincenzo Tafuri\nColor & VFX: Federico Spirito\n\nCast in Order of Appearance: Elisa Ceccarelli, Federico Isaia\n\nArtist Website: http://www.acidmuffin.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/acidmuffinband\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/acidmuffinband\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/acidmuffinband\nBandCamp: https://acidmuffin.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/acidmuffin\n\nLabel Name: K2 Music\nLabel Website: http://www.k2music.org\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Smoking My Little Soul\"\n\nI'm twisted on this stone\n\nfor not being original\n\nthe cross burning on the edge\n\nbut there is no sign of sin\n\n\n\nI'm walking in a swish\n\nas real as making love\n\nthe cross burning on the edge\n\na nice way to die alone\n\n\n\nI'm doing what you ask\n\nIt's like stripping the soul\n\nI’m here and I want you\n\nbut there is no trace of you\n\n\n\nI'm walking in a swish\n\nit’s never enough anyway\n\nthe cross burning on the edge\n\na nice way to die alone\n\n\n\nopen your arms\n\nopen your heart\n\nover my honesty\n\nsmoking my little soul\n\n\n\nmy time is over\n\nmy life is over\n\nmy love is lost\n\nI'll be yours forever\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32GF4ujGYlA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32GF4ujGYlA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32GF4ujGYlA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32GF4ujGYlA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32GF4ujGYlA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":268,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"32GF4ujGYlA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Vke2VqkXDyJavkLcYGRUseNCa_I\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlFwRllwTE5UdjZB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T23:31:51.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Double Experience - \"AI Freaks Me Out\" Colfax Rock","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Double Experience - \"AI Freaks Me Out\" - Like this video?

In just a few years, the young trio have logged 500 performances across sixteen countries and have obtained international radio (Idobi Radio), festivals (BBC Introducing) and media (Global TV) support alike, with no additional power-ups provided by agencies or labels. Their recent album, 'Unsaved Progress', was released in the spring of 2016 and reached #6 on the National Loud Chart, spawning the viral anthem for the video game Destiny in the process.

Speak up I can't fucking hear you. Place the poison in my ear and ask me what I fear. So, take a look around you, you think your God has finally found you. Work in the dark, in the name of the light, you abuse their mistrust. Is this the good lords mite. War. Inside the fire grows, it consumes my once good soul. The touch of the devil it feels ice cold, it numbs my mind and chills my bones. My minds at peace. Welcome your immunity. You live life like an unholy gift, your nothing but a fucking rat. Strap it on, hook it up to feel the buzz, but you kill kids and that makes you a fucking cunt. Another waste of skin that time forgot. Bleurgh. Whether it's a god, or a good given martyr. You think it's dark? It's about to get darker. Go and prey in the name of the father, Just hope he doesn't bend you over the alter. Caught in a scapegoat of religion and lust, There is no god, only rotten rusted ruins of us. I just hope you've learnt your lesson, There's no hope, only blood fills the path too heaven.

Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam and Nirvana), and on the other one it goes more toward the Post Rock atmosphere.\n\nAfter a strong live activity throughout Italy, including shows with Arcane Roots, Il Teatro Degli Orrori, L7, The Quireboys and Sham 69, the band has just finished working on first full-length album “Bloop” which will be published on November 7th 2016 in collaboration with K2 Music.\n\nThe sound that you’ll find in their new album is the exactly one that actually identifies the Acid Muffin: majestic and theatrical, a middle path between the surreal sound of Post Rock and the brainy music of Alternative Rock, absolutely modern and innovative.\n\nThe 'Bloop' promotional tour brings Acid Muffin to Germany as a direct support of Black Stone Cherry on September 4th|5th|6th 2017.\n\nAcid Muffin is: Marco Pasqualucci - Guitar & Vocals; Grabiel Alvarez - Bass & Backing Vocals; Andrea Latini - Drums\n\nDirector Name: Michel Chabaneau\nProducer Name: Michel Chabaneau\n\nArtist Website: http://www.acidmuffin.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/acidmuffinband\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/acidmuffinband\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/acidmuffinband\nBandCamp: https://acidmuffin.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/acidmuffin\n\nLabel Name: K2 Music\nLabel Website: http://www.k2music.org\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Turning & Suffering\"\n\ncome to tease my fall\n\nI’m not myself\n\nturning and suffering\n\nI like how the poison\n\nbeat me and fuck me\n\ncome on\n\ntake my soul\n\n\nsave the blood\n\nand now I think I know\n\nsave the beast\n\nthe princess dies again\n\nI fell and I can not choose to die for you\n\nthere where the cold does not touch\n\nyou are the fire\n\nschizophrenia and Jesus\n\nin the sound of mind\n\nmotherfucker sad\n\nmoon and rotation\n\ngroin groin groin\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XboI-4G4Alk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XboI-4G4Alk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XboI-4G4Alk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XboI-4G4Alk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XboI-4G4Alk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":277,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"XboI-4G4Alk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/mixNwdbDfEKiCLqy_GWjIQG7aE4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlNzTF9EUE5rQXM0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-29T17:30:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Bastian - \"The Shakedown\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Bastian - \"The Shakedown\" - Like this video?

The singer-songwriter has been writing and performing for as long as she can remember and has no intentions of slowing down - in fact, this is just the beginning. Maggie has opened for nationally touring artists and bands such as State Champs, Reeve Carney, Dalton Rapattoni, and Like Pacific, and is thankful for all of the support she has received from friends, family, and her favorite artists alike.\n   Maggie's music is best described as fresh, honest, and open-hearted; her love of life and optimistic point of view shine through each word that she sings, no matter what story she is telling. In May 2016, Maggie released her debut album, 'Insomniac.' To her, the album is all about the importance of love and friendship. While these themes are still very prominent in the artist's new music, it is undeniable that both Maggie and her songwriting have matured. Maggie's new EP, \"Tinted Glasses\" (produced by Rian Dawson of All Time Low) is all about what she has learned in the last two years about people, relationships, and of course, herself. She feels incredibly excited and blessed to be working with Rian, and hopes that this EP will impact listeners as much as writing the songs impacted her. It is a beginning of a new era, and Maggie is ready to share her story. \n\nDirector Name: Britain Weyant \n\nArtist Website: http://www.rockinmags.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/rockinmags\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/rockin_mags\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/rockinmags\n\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Tinted Glasses\"\n\nStanding on the edge\nHoping this is real\nNot knowing how to act\nNot knowing how you feel\nI tripped over your words\nYou stumbled through your lines\nI kept stalling through the pain\nAnd waiting for the signs - of all that's true\nI want to be with you\n\nSo why, wont you look at me\nIt's getting hard to see\nYou through these tinted glasses in the pouring rain\nAnd why, can't we be, in harmony\nThings won't ever be the same\nAnd you've only got time to blame\n\nI wanna jump right in\nBut your caught up in the waves\nIt's getting darker now\nAnd I'm counting the days \ntil I see you again\nWe may not know where or when\nBut I can't get your smile out of my head\n\n\nYou're always desiring change\nAnd my hearts ready to be reclaimed\n\nSo why, wont you look at me\nIt's getting hard to see\nYou through these tinted glasses in the pouring rain\nAnd why, can't we be, in harmony\nThings won't ever be the same\nAnd I've  only got time to blame\n\nIt's funny how the weeks go by, life passes before your eyes  and ya don't say much of anything\n\n\nSo why, wont you look at me\nIt's getting hard to see\nYou through these tinted glasses in the pouring rain\nAnd why, can't we be, in harmony\nThings won't ever be the same\nJust let go of your fears and give me a chance\nYou've changed my world with just one glance\nAnd we've still only got time to blame\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O00hLLrvISE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O00hLLrvISE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O00hLLrvISE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O00hLLrvISE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O00hLLrvISE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":280,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"O00hLLrvISE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/9LfBmiYLcm9zYET08x1_CHZDSd4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjFwN2Q3cm5NV1VR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-03T02:02:25.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Kinn-ocks - \"豆腐ケーキ (Tofucake)\" Pig Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Kinn-ocks - \"豆腐ケーキ (Tofucake)\" - Like this video?

Chuggy guitar riffs, kick drum blasts and spitfire vocals define the band’s sound, but while their music brings the pit to your ears, Liz’s brutally honest lyrics get to your gut. The frontwoman is open about her struggles with anxiety, self-harm and panic disorder, an overarching theme in Gold Steps’ catalogue. “I know what it’s like to hurt, to feel alone, to want to give up in a moment of darkness; if we can make one person feel understood and less alone, we have been successful.”\nThe ups and downs of mental health burst and bloom on Gold Steps’ new EP, 'Incandescent'. Liz explains, “these songs reflect my mental state at different points of my life in the last year: fiercely refusing to give up in the face of adversity; struggling with my sense of purpose outside the band; and glimpses of hope that I was ‘getting better,’ just to knock myself out again with self-esteem issues.” Tracked at Overcast Recordings and produced by Rick King of King Sound, the 7-track EP showcases the band’s musical growth, with bright leads and fill-heavy drums supporting melodies that span the vocalist’s full range. The band also explores the experience of someone observing a loved one struggle in closing track “Manic to Panic,” which expresses feelings of trying to understand, while reassuring “we’ll get through it again.”\nLiz, Zach, and original bassist David Ramirez (who also contributed to the EP, 'Incandescent') set out in 2016 to create punchy, hard-hitting music in the vein of New Found Glory, State Champs and Hit The Lights. Armed with a name inspired by genre heavyweights Neck Deep, they quickly penned and recorded their debut EP 'Louder Than Words' at Blackroom Studios. In their short tenure, Gold Steps has played nearly a hundred shows, sharing stages with The Ataris, Aaron Gillespie, Ace Enders, Forever Came Calling and Jonny Craig; touring the Southwest; and performing at So What? Music Festival and SXSW. They’ve partnered with nonprofit HeartSupport to spread awareness and reduce stigma around mental health issues, addiction and self-harm.\n\nDirector Name: Timekeeper Media\nProducer Name: Rick King at King Sound\n\nArtist Website: https://www.goldstepsband.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/goldstepsatx\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/goldstepsatx\nReverbNation:  https://www.reverbnation.com/goldsteps \nBandCamp: https://goldsteps.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/goldstepsatx\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Firestarter\"\n\nThe ember still glows\n\nIn a life where we don’t have time for trust\nAnd it’s always about “me”\nNot “you” or “us”\nYou can’t make anything stick\nForget what won’t spark in an instant\n\nWorn our knuckles down to the bone\nWon’t rest until the record shows\nThe ember still glows\n\nThis is what it comes down to\nWhat are you willing to do?\nFor a chance to make this last\nGet out and run as fast as you can\nWould you sell your soul for it?\nWork to the bone and bleed for it?\nOr do you expect a handout\nWe’re coming to burn you out\n\nForget about who won’t make a difference\nAnd hold close to the ones that listened\nAll along\nThe coals that still ignite the dawn\n\nFrom embers flames have grown\nFound the spark\nGrew light from the dark\nWhere we once saw the end\nShines a brand new start\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4_JPoBHRlOo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4_JPoBHRlOo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4_JPoBHRlOo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4_JPoBHRlOo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4_JPoBHRlOo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":285,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4_JPoBHRlOo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/_uiE5adSBCOqMSZpSQ0bvTkEp48\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjhYak55NEVyTmpZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-01T21:21:08.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Yellow Dog Conspiracy - \"Somebody Else\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Yellow Dog Conspiracy - \"Somebody Else\" - Like this video?

The current lineup consists of vocalist Vice, lead guitarist Luiz Arantes, bassist Nuno Correia, drummer Alex Zuk and rhythm guitarist Josh Riot.\nThe band released one EP in June 2013, and after four years of work and several lineup changes, Yellow Dog Conspiracy released their debut studio album 'Confrontation' in March 2017, produced and mixed by Brad Cox and legendary producer Mike Clink.\nConfrontation is a guitar driven, balls to the walls hard rock album. It features eleven tracks, ranging from intense, political and rebellious subjects like “Enough Is Enough” and “Revenge”, to more soft and inspiring songs like “We Need a Change” and “One to Blame”. Thrown into the mix are some pretty catchy tunes like “Falling Into You”, “Don’t Lie to Me” and “Break it Down”, some fiery and vibrant themes like “Cocaine to the Vein” and “Somebody Else” and some melodic punked up songs like “Skinny Little Man” and “Hello My Friend”. It aims to be a solid, modern, original album showcasing YDC's personality.\n\nDirector Name: Pedro Salvado\nProducer Name: Yellow Dog Conspiracy\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/yellowdogconspiracy/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/yellowdogconspi\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/yellowdogconspiracy/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Somebody Else\"\n\nIT WAS FATE THAT WE MET IN THE PLACE THAT WAS MEANT\nBIG MISTAKE I REGRET BUT COULD NOT ESCAPE\nMADE ME BELIEVE\n\nDOLLAR SIGNS IN HER EYES, FANCY CARS IN HER MIND\nBUT I WAS BLIND BY THE LOOKS AND ALL THE GOODS\nWAS SO DECEIVED, WAS SO NAIV\n\nBREAK THE LOCK, BEAT THE CLOCK, DON’T STOP, PLAY THE SLOT,\nIN THIS GAME YOU TAKE ME TO THE TOP\nYOU THINK I NEED YOU\n\nCOULDN’T WAIT TOOK THE BAIT IN THE CAGE\nJUST TO FIND IT WAS FAKE\nNOW ITS LATE AND I’M TRAPPED INSIDE\nYOU THINK I WANT  YOU\n\nNOW THAT SOMEBODY ELSE COMES IN MY LIFE\nNOW THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL CHANGE MY MIND\n\nYOU’RE SO GOOD AT BREAKING PEOPLE DOWN TO THE GROUND\nWHILE YOU NEVER (EVER) LOOK INTO YOURSELF\nYOU THINK YOU KNOW ME\n\nYOU THINK YOU CAN PLAY ME A ROUND ANY TIME ANY WHE RE\nTILL YOU PUT ME TO THE SHELF\nYOU THINK YOU OWN ME\n\nNOW THAT SOMEBODY ELSE CAME IN MY LIFE\nNOW THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS CHANGED MY MIND\n\nYOU THINK YOU KNOW ME...YOU THINK YOU OWN ME\nNOW THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS CHANGED MY MIND\n\nYOU THINK YOU CAN USE AND ABUSE\nWELL HONEY LET ME TELL YOU THAT YOU\nGOT ME CONFUSED\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED\n\nYOU THINK YOU CAN DO ALL YOU WANT\nWHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY TRAPPED\nINSIDE THEIR HEART \nTOOK ME FOR GRANTED\nBUT THAT’S HOW IT ENDED\n\nWHEN SOMEBODY ELSE CAME IN MY LIFE\nJUST WAIT THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL SCREW YOUR MIND\nI'M SURE THAT SOMEBODY ELSE\nI BET THAT SOMEBODY ELSE\nTRUST THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL SCREW YOUR LIFE\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8XjNy4ErNjY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8XjNy4ErNjY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8XjNy4ErNjY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8XjNy4ErNjY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8XjNy4ErNjY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":286,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"8XjNy4ErNjY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/XPIxzzkdwIc3H17GE959fPadzDw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk96ankzb1VpbXZr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-31T22:33:49.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Ditches - \"My Head\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Ditches - \"My Head\" - Like this video?

The band showcases a straightforward style of punk rock and roll infused with hook-laden choruses and raw-rock guitar chords, hearkening back to old school punk bands such as The Misfits, The Ramones and Social Distortion.\n\n\"Bordertown Devils play bare knuckle punk rock as it oughta be, they acknowledge the past and their influences, but they have delivered their debut EP in a style that is very much their own ... they deliver a pumped up crossbreed of punk and rock n’ roll that hits the spot on pretty much every track.\" - The Punksite.com\n\nDirector Name: Wolf Dangler\nProducer Name: Bordertown Devils\n\nAbout the Video: The song \"Hell Cell\" is based on a poem that was written and composed by a friend of the band while she was in prison. The video is meant to convey the feelings of isolation, hopelessness, and dread that are often a constant while being incarcerated. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.bordertowndevils.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bordertowndevils/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BorderTWNDevils\nBandCamp: https://bordertowndevils.bandcamp.com/releases\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bordertowndevils/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/13YFe2RbrR3QMVchpVS4SB\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Hell Cell\"\n\nMy trip is tired and sad\nI made a deal for drowning my past\nIn a tower of concrete and stone\nA place of misery I can call home\n\nThey keep me subdued in concrete and steel\nNothing can stop all the pain that I feel\nI scream so loud it hurts my ears\nI scream for help but can't she hear\n\nThe way that we live is the way we die\nThe way we die\nCan't you see it's the way that we open up the door\nohhh wohh ohh ohhhhh\n\nWatch the rain fall from the sky\nHe took a swing so I blackened his eye\nArchangel who sits at God's side\nWhere he watches with strength and pride\n\nI know I look for the answers I seek\nI dwell in hell and for heaven I reach\nBorn to die we live in vain\nMy tears are the proof that my soul burns in hell\n\nThe way that we live is the way we die\nThe way we die\nCan't you see it's the way that we open up the door\nohhh wohh ohh ohhhhh\n\nThe way that we live is the way we die\nThe way we die\nCan't you see it's the way that we open up the door\nThe way that we live is the way we die\nThe way we die\nCan't you see it's the way that we open up the door\nohhh wohh ohh ohhhhh\nOPEN THE DOOR\nOPEN THE DOOR\nThe way that we open up the door\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxHDeDpFRdk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxHDeDpFRdk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxHDeDpFRdk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxHDeDpFRdk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxHDeDpFRdk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":288,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"AxHDeDpFRdk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/PdY4oO5lhK-Eb9S73B86iRX2N3c\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk9uSk9XNjhRbFRB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-28T02:51:16.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Syteria - \"Revolution\" Official World Premiere Teaser - 4/6/18 - TOMMOROW!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Syteria - \"Revolution\" (Teaser) - Like this video?

Blending these genres, the band evokes spirits of heavy riffs and hot amp tubes overridden and pushed to the limits soon to be heard on their debut EP “SOLACE”.\n\n“After releasing very heavy black metal for 3+ yrs with my band Eohum, I wanted to return to blues and doom oriented music and expression, with atmosphere, blues solos and more feeling. Both Morgan Zwicker (drums) and Daniel Paras (bass) are distinct musicians / vocalists with jazz/blues backgrounds whom had the will to jump on board.” says band founder Jeremy Perkins.\n\nHitting the jam space and recruiting some special guests Matt McGachy (Cryptopsy) and Barrie Butler (Eohum), WYKAN’s debut EP “Solace” features three punishing tracks full of atmosphere and mystery where you can hear black metal rage meet the finest components of blues and harsh psych stoner riffs. The theme of the EP follows inspiration of Ethnobotany and magic along with a tribal take on ritual and ceremony. More specifically with the Northern European Tribes known as the Saami from Finland/Norway/Sweden areas of today and their usage of Amanita Muscaria mushroom for Shamanic practices. Overall, the EPs concept is a reminder of the brisk realities of our lives in relation to the spirit world.\n\n“Solace” is due out on April 13, 2018 and available for pre-order at Bandcamp.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/WYKANBAND/\nBandCamp: https://wykan.bandcamp.com/releases\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnULL-7kNeZMANNqiJvdtTg/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JH-drNsZM-Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JH-drNsZM-Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JH-drNsZM-Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JH-drNsZM-Q/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JH-drNsZM-Q/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":291,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"JH-drNsZM-Q"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/AV0FlpQkNhXWM2o6enWjMfdpYQo\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkdlMEExR29QeFhn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-31T21:56:47.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Greystone Canyon - \"Astral Plane\" Rockshots Records - Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Greystone Canyon - \"Astral Plane\" - Like this video?

Now, joining those Aussie giants of rock are GREYSTONE CANYON!\n\nThe name GREYSTONE CANYON is inspired by the freedom of wide open landscapes, something Australia and America very much have in common.\n\n“It was inspired by our love for the old western films and the images these films conjure. The vast plains, endless horizons, the freedom, and heck, GREYSTONE CANYON is one hell of a cool name for rock/ metal band!” says vocalist /guitarist Darren Cherry.\n\nGREYSTONE CANYON will release their debut album 'While the Wheels Still Turn' on March 9, 2018, in Europe, U.S.A and Canada through Rockshots Records and on Hellfire Records in Australia on March 12, 2018.\n\n'While the Wheels Still Turn' was tracked at the splendidly named Goatsound Studios in Melbourne, Australia, and then mixed in Canada, making ‘the album a real rock n’ roll frequent flyer. Mixing duties were undertaken by none other than Grammy nominated producer and legend Glen Robinson, who had engineered, mixed and produced equally legendary acts like Annihilator, Queensryche and Voivod\n\nInspired by legends like Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, Megadeth and King Diamond, “While The Wheels Still Turn” is an album that could not only sit well beside the works of those legends, but with the current tsunami of all things 70s and 80s inspired, GREYSTONE CANYON are in the right place at the right time. We are travelling back to the future and they are the soundtrack!\n\nAs vocalist/guitarist Darren Cherry proudly states:\n“We really wanted to make an album similar to old Ozzy Osbourne record where songs like ‘I Don’t Know’ and ‘Goodbye to Romance’ can sit comfortably. This is music from the heart and soul!”\n\n(Bio written by Steve Earles)\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/greystonecanyon\n\nLabel Name: Rockshots Records\nLabel Website: http://www.rockshots.eu/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ge0A1GoPxXg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ge0A1GoPxXg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ge0A1GoPxXg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ge0A1GoPxXg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ge0A1GoPxXg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":292,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Ge0A1GoPxXg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/tEgkji3kWlAraSNdudFzfj-jVOw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkhrbWVsVS1YMzVN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-31T21:43:16.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Acid Muffin - \"The Last Illusion\" K2 Music - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Acid Muffin - \"The Last Illusion\" - Like this video?

Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam and Nirvana), and on the other one it goes more toward the Post Rock atmosphere.\n\nAfter a strong live activity throughout Italy, including shows with Arcane Roots, Il Teatro Degli Orrori, L7, The Quireboys and Sham 69, the band has just finished working on first full-length album “Bloop” which will be published on November 7th 2016 in collaboration with K2 Music.\n\nThe sound that you’ll find in their new album is the exactly one that actually identifies the Acid Muffin: majestic and theatrical, a middle path between the surreal sound of Post Rock and the brainy music of Alternative Rock, absolutely modern and innovative.\n\nThe “Bloop” promotional tour brings Acid Muffin to Germany as a direct support of Black Stone Cherry on September 4th|5th|6th 2017.\n\nAcid Muffin is: Marco Pasqualucci - Guitar & Vocals; Grabiel Alvarez - Bass & Backing Vocals; Andrea Latini - Drums\n\nDirector: Vincenzo Tafuri\nProducer: Timeless Production\nPhotography: Samir Iacovone - Federico Spirito\nCamera Operator: Francesco Calzolari\n1°Assistant Operator: Simone Crea\n2°Assistant Operator: Andrea Vitiello\nSteady-Man: Vincenzo Tafuri\nSet Decorator: Adelaide Stasi\nMakeup Artist: Cristiana Leonardi\nStill Photographer: David Fricano\nEditor: Vincenzo Tafuri\nColor & VFX: Samir Iacovone\n\nCast in Order of Appearance: Tiziano Floreani, David Fricano, Andrea Vitielo, Deborha Gentile, Isabella Dumby, Umberto Marrapodi, Giovanni Ianello, Marco Federici, Vinicio Riccardi, Adelaide Stasi, Ylenia Taveri, Deborah D'Onofrio, Jessica Amarilli, Federico Spirito.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.acidmuffin.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/acidmuffinband\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/acidmuffinband\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/acidmuffinband\nBandCamp: https://acidmuffin.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/acidmuffin\n\nLabel Name: K2 Music\nLabel Website: http://www.k2music.org\n\nSong Lyrics: \"The Last Illusion\"\n\nwhere are you going?\n\nI have not found God and comfort\n\nand now I burn in my misery\n\n\n\nI tried to bury you\n\ndon't feel empty\n\nand now\n\nhow are you?\n\nI live in the ring of fire\n\n\n\nthe roads are like long snakes\n\nand timeless\n\nwet and cold as death\n\naround you\n\n\n\nnothing changes as it should\n\nnothing is how you feel\n\nhow you feel inside\n\naround you\n\n\n\nI don't need excuses\n\nI'll be ready when you'll come to pick me up\n\nI'll be ready to tackle the last illusion\n\n\n\ndon't let me down\n\n\n\nthe last illusion\n\nthe last illusion\n\nthe last illusion\n\n\n\ndon't let me down\n\n\n\nthis is a new world\n\npoisoned monkeys\n\nI found a new way out\n\nand don't change my name\n\n\n\nthis is a new world\n\nI'm lost in this world\n\nI found a new way out\n\nand don't change my name\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HkmelU-X35M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HkmelU-X35M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HkmelU-X35M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HkmelU-X35M/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HkmelU-X35M/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":293,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HkmelU-X35M"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/xnsCKe87ufm-S3FD9vkxvDK0Yo4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjBjYzUxOGd3T2hF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-28T22:29:23.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Legal Kill - \"Confined\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Legal Kill - \"Confined\" - Like this video?

He was able to maintain a significant following during his tenure at the university. Greg would perform around campus during student activity events and anywhere in the city that permitted him. During college, Greg began to draw many comparisons to Drake because he could easily create lyrics in addition to singing on tracks as well. His first major single, \"Like a Stripper\", received regional acclaim around the south, which lead to many tours. Greg first award came in 2015 as he won the Hip Hop artist of the year at the Charlotte Music Awards (CMA). Later that year, riding off his new single and performance from the CMA, Big Greg sealed a Hollywood Music in Media (HMMA) nomination finalist for his new hit single \"Like a Stripper\". Greg won the Matador Green Energy Drink theme song contest and the company (Matador) now fully sponsors his events when he performs around the country. As of November 2016, \"You Can Have It All\" won the Hollywood Music in Media Awards (HMMA) for song of the year in Hollywood, California. \n\nDirector Name: Cambriel Polite\nProducer Name: Kloud Nine Music\n\nAbout the Video: The music video \"You Can Have It All\" captures a young couple who loves spending time with each other but they are dealing with a potential diagnosis in which one of them will be left with memories of the other.  This video is dedicated to all of the loved one that we have all lost due to this illness and we want to show our admiration and for all the fighters and survivors.  \n\nArtist Website: https://www.biggregplk.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/biggregplk\nTwitter: @biggregplk\nYouTube: @biggregplk\nSoundCloud: @biggregplk\nMyspace: @biggregplk\nReverbNation: @biggregplk\nInstagram: @biggregplk\nSnapChat: @biggregplk\n\nLabel Name: Manifest Music\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cTt7ljB-Um4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cTt7ljB-Um4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cTt7ljB-Um4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cTt7ljB-Um4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cTt7ljB-Um4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":298,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"cTt7ljB-Um4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/bGzHSetAXudbB8BrAihFBh2Ujm8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjhDVzZSUVNfZTA0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-27T22:51:20.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Savan DePaul - \"Nebula Rock\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Savan DePaul - \"Nebula Rock\" - Like this video?

He eschews the normal conventions of hip hop and electronic music and opts for a vibe that is unlike any other on this planet.  His ethereal synths, worldbeat-influenced rhythms, zany flows, and unorthodox approach to writing and structuring lyrics make for a listening experience that is more akin to music from another galaxy than anything resembling conventional pop tunes.  This wildly radical ethos has made Savan DePaul one of the most unique characters in the underground rap scene today.\n\nDirector Name:  Savan DePaul\nProducer Name:  Savan DePaul\n\nAbout the Video: The psychedelic trip that accompanies \"Nebula Rock\" embodies the blissful doom of DePaul's bars as well as the throbbing hip house instrumentation.  It is a dance floor banger for a dying species, one last hurrah before the asteroid eliminates what is left of Homo sapiens.

He was born in Cagliari (Italy) on the 17th of march 1987. Since the young age of 6 he devoted a great passion for music and love for electric bass guitar. Between the age of 6 and 11 he constantly studied and played his instrument, improving his knowledge as a self-taught and keeping on trying to set up a band. His first band and live performance were carried out at the age of 11, within a death-metal band called Necroid. Later on he developed several music projects that ranged from punk, rock, crossover to heavy metal.\nAt the age of 13 he joined in a Dream Theater tribute band called “Zyro”; Then he found his ideal dimension in a definitely more atypical band called Bremys, inspired by exceptional styles such as those of Tool, A Perfect Circle and Katatonia. With that band he recorded two albums “Bremys (2008)”, “Resurgo (2009)”, and the official music video “Quel che non c’é”. He had the honor to share the stage with some internationally known artist and to go on tour through Italy.\nOn the whole he spent several years performing live gigs with many bands of different styles: hardcore, metal, rock, thrash, stoner, funk.\nLucio Manca founded in 2006 “First of All Agency” booking, management and promotion agency with collaborators from different parts of Italy workin’ togheter to support bands, selling merch, organizing events, booking tours, managing and promoting.\nHe also was the founding member, singer and composer in a parallel project called Bavarja. This thrash band owes its style to that of Pantera and Sepultura. That band recorded three demos so far “Chi saprà Accettare sempre Diprezzerà”, “Nodo alla Gola”, “Official Live” (one of which live) and reached the number of more than a hundred gigs during few years.\n\nDirector Name: Natalia Ghiani/Food for Ravens Photography\nProducer Name: Matteo Spiga, Lucio Manca\n\nAbout the Video: All Music Written and Composed by Lucio Manca © 2016 Bass, Guitars and Keyboards Recorded by Lucio Manca at \"LM STUDIO\" \nCagliari, Sardinia (Italy)\nDrums Recorded by Garry King at \"LA FORET GROUPE PRODUCTIONS\" (France) www.garrykingmic.com Mixed & Mastered by Matteo Spiga\n\nArtist Website: https://www.luciomanca.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/luciomancapage\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/luciomancatw\nMySpace: https://myspace.com/luciomancamusic\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/luciomanca\nBandCamp: https://luciomanca.bandcamp.com/releases\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/luciomanca\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lucio-manca\n\nLabel Name: CDBaby\nWebsite: https://www.cdbaby.com/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Servo del Rimpianto\"\n\nSei il vetro di uno specchio che deforma la realtà la nuova luce che ti sfiora non mi guarirà La vita é come polvere, la guardo e vola via E' inutile rincorrermi, io non avrò pietà La nuova luce che ti sfiora non mi guarirà La vita é la tua polvere Io non avrò pietà.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nPpH0FoO24/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nPpH0FoO24/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nPpH0FoO24/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nPpH0FoO24/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nPpH0FoO24/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":301,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_nPpH0FoO24"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/pKMiYFbKKxd0GXq6b5eVDeDCtro\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkszdXNWQWdDUHln","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-27T20:13:38.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"22Hertz - \"Get the Hell Out\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - 22Hertz - \"Get the Hell Out\" - Like this video?

Pete Mac - Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: Cork, Ireland\n\nArtist Biography: Paradox are an Alternative Rock band from Cork, Ireland. Formed in 1997 by brothers Pete Mac and Mike Mac the early Paradox sound was heavily influenced by the Grunge Era of the 90's.The band has shaped and evolved their sound over the years while still maintaining their Alternative Rock sound. Paradox have released four studio albums to date. Their debut album 'Circle of Growth' was recorded in Los Angeles in 2000 and released on a US label. Their second album 'Sacred' was recorded and released in 2004, 'Corporate Pollution' was released in 2011 and their latest album 'Chapters' released in 2015. Singer and songwriter Pete Mac also recorded and released a solo album in 2009 in Berlin, Germany. \nParadox have toured both Europe and the US as well as playing support to the likes of Therapy?, Kerbdog and Shonen Knife. \n2014 saw Paradox back in the studio recording their 4th album to date at Wavefield Recording Studios in Bantry, West Cork with multi tasking musician and engineer Brian Casey on the desk. \nTitled 'Chapters' the 14 track album combines a variety of new sounds some of which have not yet been heard on any previous Paradox album. 'Chapters' has been gaining momentum since it's release in 2015. The band kicked off 2016 with a new single and music video titled 'EAT' which was nominated at the Indie Cork Film Festival and the RATMA Film Festival in the UK. \n2017 saw the release of the new single 'All Life Matters', an eagerly awaited follow up to the bands last album 'Chapters'. ‘All Life Matters’ takes a similar direction to the previous Paradox album ‘Chapters’ which was also recorded at Wavefield. Singer Songwriter Pete Mac plays all instruments on the track with Brian Casey adding keys and piano. \n\nDirector Name: Pete Mac\nProducer Name: Jota Gambuzino\n\nAbout the Video: \"All Life Matters\" is the eagerly awaited follow up single from Irish based Alternative Rock band Paradox to their last album 'Chapters'. \n'All Life Matters' plays like a ballad while criticizing the current media climate. Singer Songwriter Pete Mac plays all instruments on the track with Brian Casey adding keys and piano. The video takes a sarcastic twisted view on social media and how today's society is influenced by information received through this form of media. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.paradoxrock.com/ \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/paradoxrock\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/petemacparadox\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/paradoxrock\nBandCamp: https://paradoxgrunge.bandcamp.com/ \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/35eE31cE8TR1fAf5WSIWwU \n\nSong Lyrics: \"All Life Matters\"\n\nSaw the news today I’ve had enough\nI recognise this place\nWatch the world decay I’ve seen enough\nI recognise his face\n\nSaw the news today I’ll disconnect\nDon’t recognise this place\nThat was yesterday I’ll soon forget\nDon’t recognise his race\n\nAll Life Matters\nWhatever race or colour\nAll Life Matters\nWe’re trading one for another\n\nSaw the news today I’ve had enough\nI recognise this place\nIn a world that’s set on self destruct\nWe'll blow it all away\nWatched the news today can’t enough of everybody’s pain\nIn a world that couldn’t give a fuck\nDon’t recognise his name\n\nAll Life Matters \nWhatever race or colour\nAll Life Matters\nWe all feel pain and suffer\nAll Life Matters\n\nThere’s a white man in his suit\nHe’s laying down the rules\nHis own stupidity is playing on a fool\nWhile his own mortality is hanging on a noose\n\nSaw the news today I’ve had enough\nI recognise this place\nBut that was yesterday I’ll soon forget\nDon’t recognise his race\n\nAll Life Matters\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GBWuPgnkGPs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GBWuPgnkGPs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GBWuPgnkGPs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GBWuPgnkGPs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GBWuPgnkGPs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":307,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"GBWuPgnkGPs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/OKAfV-v-qCQX2AS74r8cc5XJ6ms\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlBFTzBYMkk0ODBn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-25T01:09:44.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Talk Show Host - \"I Hate Men (I Hate All Men)\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Talk Show Host - \"I Hate Men (I Hate All Men)\" - Like this video?

The song’s title, “I Hate Men (I Hate All Men)”, is not meant to be taken sarcastically: the song skewers male entitlement, with verses delivered by an oblivious narrator who represents the worst of male privilege. One Redditor declared that the lyrics were \"the most cuck\" he had ever heard, so the band considers that a success.\nThe trio enlisted French director Judith Florent-Lapara to visually capture the essence of the song. The video features a crew of energetic teenage girls ready to laugh at the ongoing presence of the patriarchy in the music scene. “I was inspired by women's groups that have marked the history of feminist music — like the Runaways, the Riot Grrl movement or even the Spice Girls — and I wanted to form a group of badass girls; the teenage aesthetic and the ’90s are completely part of my universe,” says Florent-Lapara. “I chose Noémie to play the leader of the group because not only she is an actress, but also a confirmed feminist activist. I was also inspired by the personality and style of the actresses, so everything was natural and the girls had fun while we were shooting. And it was really nice to work with 14- or 15-year-old girls who are motivated and full of energy.\nShe also notes that she wanted the video to have an upbeat tone: “I think that sometimes you need to include humour in activist projects. It’s important for the public to see that being engaged in politics and activism is not always violent and serious, but sometimes you can also have a good laugh at misogyny.”\n\nArtist Website: http://www.talkshowhost.ca\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/talkshowhost.ca\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/talkshowhost_ca\nBandCamp: http://welovetalkshowhost.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/talkshowhostrocks\n\nSong Lyrics: \"I Hate Men (I Hate All Men)\"\n\ni can do what i want i can say what i please i can go where i choose i can take what i need i can take a little more and i can guarantee i won't step to the side or give up my seat i won't listen to reason or change my opinion probably won't even notice when the chorus sings: i hate men i hate all men we're insufferable i hate men i hate all men we're malevolent, unintelligent and irrelevant, y'know and who let us run the show? i'm a powerful guy i'm distinguished and tough look me in the eye and try to understand: i set the lowest bar and get the upper hand you're a fly on my car you're a steak i could (over)cook you're obligated to suffer unsolicited bluster lemme stop you there and tell you why you're wrong (chorus) madeleine: when i'm walking all alone one finger on my phone don't look at me, don't talk to me i just wanna make it home you're a virulent stain of insignificant pus an obsolete machine a disfigure of speech and when the train doors close i hope they catch on your teeth\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PEO0X2I480g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PEO0X2I480g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PEO0X2I480g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PEO0X2I480g/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PEO0X2I480g/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":308,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"PEO0X2I480g"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/BJj5YSJqlQWaAc4chzdyjWFoIfo\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnFTTVNzRmNKWmJj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-23T20:00:06.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Melisandre’s Beaver - \"Charging Up\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Melisandre’s Beaver - \"Charging Up\" - Like this video?

All four of them were stabbed and severely injured by fascists. One of the activists that was attacked ended up with a severe head trauma and was put in a coma, there was no certainty if he would live to see this video. The following day a spontaneous rally of two thousand people started and six days later the story of the event had spread. This lead to ten thousand people coming together in a protest to show that they will not tolerate or give in to the fascists threat of violence. If one falls, a thousand will rise. Anti-fascism is always self-defense.\n\nArtist Website: https://thebristles.wordpress.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thebristles\nBandCamp: https://thebristles.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/thebristles/\n\nLabel Name: Just 4 Fun Records, Heptown Records, Pike Records, Civilisation Records\nLabel Website: https://www.facebook.com/HepTownRecords/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Showan\"\n\nhillbilly redneck nazis - went to town to pick fights\nagitated drunk high stoned - armed with bottles and knives\n\nShowan - cops and nazis \nShowan - for sure\nShowan - court and nazis\nShowan - and more\nShowan in intensive care - fighting for his life\nthe nazis in Ukraine - fighting for the white side\n\nShowan\n\nhillbilly redneck nazis - went to town to pick fights\nagitated drunk high stoned - armed with bottles and knives\n \nShowan - cops and nazis \nShowan - for sure\nShowan - court and nazis\nShowan - and more\nShowan - cops and court\nShowan - letting the nazis go\n \nShowan - cops and nazis \nShowan - for sure\nShowan - court and nazis\nShowan - and more\nShowan - cops and court\nShowan - letting the nazis go\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NJb7s4s2lFE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NJb7s4s2lFE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NJb7s4s2lFE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NJb7s4s2lFE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NJb7s4s2lFE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":315,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NJb7s4s2lFE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/F68nMlDC_22eYY3IzlnpK12hlEE\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkhXa3RLWHVjMUtF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-23T03:15:25.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Carnivals - \"Leave It All Behind\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Carnivals - \"Leave It All Behind\" - Like this video?

BlankTV.com!\n \n***\nThe Dub Righters - \"True Sound Killaz\" Plasterer Records\n\nArtist city, country: London, England, UK\n\nArtist Biography: London-reggae punks, The Dub Righters, hit the road this March in support of their new record, True Sound Killaz, which is set for release on 9th March 2018 through Plasterer Records.\n \n\"We're super excited to be hitting the road,\" says vocalist Lawrence Harrington \"It's going to be ace to catch up with some old friends, and of course, make some new friends too, and most of all, share these new tunes to new audiences across the UK.\"\n \nTrue Sound Killaz features seven tracks of hybrid punk rock, reggae and dub that the band have become renowned for in the underground DIY scene in London. The new record follows on from 2015's self-titled EP, continuing to draw influence from classic reggae, gravel-voiced punk rock and that traditional 2-tone sound.\n \nHaving formed in late 2013, the band settled on their line up following their first gig at The Birds Nest in Deptford. Shortly before doors opened, the band realised that their then-bassist wasn't going to show, so instead of wasting a trip and disappointing the crowd, the band asked Ryan Conroy of Skub Zero, who was also playing that night, to jam on the bass. It all clicked into place and the line-up has remained the same since.\n \nThe band pride themselves on their stance on being supportive of punk rock positivity, anti-fascism, anti-sexism, anti-homophobia, animal rights and refugee rights.\n\nDirector Name: Tali Clarke\nProducer Name: Tali Clarke\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dubrighters/\nBandCamp: https://dubrighters.bandcamp.com\n\nLabel Name: Plasterer Records\nLabel Website: https://www.facebook.com/plastererrecords/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"True Sound Killaz\"\n\nrain or shine wind or tornado\ndub righters stand strong in the throng they know\nbig or small short or tall topple all\ncus the harder they come yes the harder they fall\nthey call me judge dread i put your style on trial\nkill a hundred sounds a minute or a hundred sounds a mile\nthe trick is dropping the wickedest licks\nyou can keep your sticks and stones\nas long as i got my music tricks ill always hold my own\n\ni remember back when out side the tweleve bar\nsitting drinking straight vodka\nthen pass the cider\nnext day wake up wth no hangover\npay in sit on the step all night\nno regrets hold tight to my friends in the fight\nstreet drinking crew im thinking of you\ngood times come but blink and there through\n\nreally x 7\nReally really i know\nhold tight to your friends in the fight and never let them go\nreally x 7\nReally really i care\nwhen the gun fingers lingers in the air \nyou know dub righters will be there\n(we'll be there we'll be there)\n\nrain or shine wind or tornado\ndub righters stand strong in the throng they know\nbig or small short or tall topple all\ncus the harder they come yes the harder they fall\n\ndont get it twisted like curly fry\nill surley die if its insisted that i live a lie\nthe early sky misted as i listed all the reasons why\nwhen it feels like i missed it im still gota try\n\nchilled like dilla jams\nyea im still the man\nwhen im on the mic its like\nBoom bidda bam bam billa, bam billa\nstick around and find out who's a true sound killa\nx2\n\n161 we bun the compotition\ntell me where you gonna run when the hooligan come\nslayed by my catchphrase and my slogan \ncus the show get run by the one shogun\nyou'll get left blind deaf and dumb son\nwhen i come through witht he kungfu better run\ndub righters driving the bandwagon \nlike a crouching tiger or the hidden dragon\n\nrain or shine wind or tornado\ndub righters stand strong in the throng they know\nbig or small short or tall topple all\ncus the harder they come yes the harder they fall\n\nchilled like dilla jams\nyea im still the man\nwhen im on the mic its like boom bidda bam bam billa, bam billa\nstick around and find out whos a true sound killa\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gla8xItiVlc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gla8xItiVlc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gla8xItiVlc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gla8xItiVlc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gla8xItiVlc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":324,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Gla8xItiVlc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/mvvCJKaWdwXmgJ4CbpOu6YMYkXM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnhDUjlsTXZxUG80","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-19T04:26:51.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"This Isn't Over - \"Deconstruction\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - This Isn't Over - \"Deconstruction\" - Like this video?

After twenty years of their existence the trio still remains faithful for its style. The new album is a bastard of snotty punknroll, streetpunk and some Instrumental surf music. It reflects the pure energy, the sweat and blood of over 300 Live Gigs - so far! Poison Ivvy started out in 1990 around the city of Zurich. After three vinyl EP’s and being included on many compilations all over Europe and the USA, they released in 1996 their debut album 'Call of the Wild'. One year later followed 'Cosmic Trash', which was rather harder and faster than the previous album. In 2001 the third album \"Cheap Thrills' was born. They were touring all over Europe and have been to many national and international Radio- and TV-Shows. Furthermore they supported bands like The Backyard Babies, Nashville Pussy, The Bones and many more. \n\nDirector Name: Rolf Kaser\nProducer Name: Rolf Kaser\n                \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Poison-Ivvy-194711220562109/\nMySpace: https://myspace.com/poisonivvyrocks\n\nLabel Name: Crazy Love Records\nLabel Website: http://www.crazyloverecords.de/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2oB-J1v04Uk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2oB-J1v04Uk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2oB-J1v04Uk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2oB-J1v04Uk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":326,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2oB-J1v04Uk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/pqXGowSCk10snDSohiTACDkdf0s\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lnd2MEpyT2tOTEZj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-16T22:40:12.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Enemynside - \"Devil in Disguise\" Hatestone Records","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Enemynside - \"Devil in Disguise\" - Like this video?

The songs were a mix of aggressive punk influenced pop songs, acoustic tracks, and mid-tempo straightforward rock n roll. \nAfter spending most of 2009 and 2010 recording and performing locally, they signed with Dromedary Records to release their well received first full length LP 'Strike Hard!' in December 2011 - the record was dubbed one of Indie Rock Cafe's Best New Releases of 2011 along with Jonsi and Josh Ritter. A video for the first single \"Walk On Selfishly\" came soon after in early 2012, premiered by Magnet Magazine. They spent the rest of the year performing in and around the northeast in support of the album while working on new material for future release. In 2013, they released \"I Got You\", a 4 song EP along with another video for the newly formed Pyrrhic Victory Recordings record label/collective. \nThe band's tempo slowed somewhat after the \"I Got You\" EP as Joe and John began working on other musical projects, both performing and releasing music together as the rhythm section for Kingston NY based surf/punk band Galanos, and Ryan continuing his work with NJ punk band When Thieves Are About, as well as an upcoming solo project. They continued to write and record during this period however, with the end result being November 2015's \"New Fun Hell\", a digital only 3 song release with an accompanying video for the lead track \"Hold On Tight\". This EP found the band moving away somewhat from their softer side, and more towards their driving, punk inspired sounds and sensibilities. \nThe band is now excited to announce they are working on their 2nd full length, and are releasing 2 of the new tracks 5.23.17, via a Limited Edition picture lathe cut 7” for the lead track \"Wolves and Men\", as well as a CD which will include the new tracks \"Wolves and Men\" & \"As My Body Numbs\", as well as the three songs from \"New Fun Hell\", which had yet to see a physical release until now.\n\nArtist Website: https://pyrrhicvictoryrecordings.com/the-65-s\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/the65s/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/the65s\nMySpace: https://myspace.com/the65s\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/the65s\nBandCamp: https://the65s.bandcamp.com/album/wolves-and-men …\n\nLabel Name: Pyrrhic Victory Recordings\nLabel Website: https://pyrrhicvictoryrecordings.com/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFau7GP7Pzg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFau7GP7Pzg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFau7GP7Pzg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFau7GP7Pzg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFau7GP7Pzg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":337,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sFau7GP7Pzg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Tn5AUBqClqRNKQCV11zIaIVAWGw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lkt3RDdKa2tZSjdZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-14T03:13:19.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Purest of Pain - \"The Solipsist\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Purest of Pain - \"The Solipsist\" - Like this video?

We wanted to write something that spoke exactly how we felt. This song is about fur and, by consequences, about animals mistreatment. We don't understand why a lot of animals are killed for their fur. Most people of the world don't need fur to protect from the cold, we have a lot of alternative clothes for that. Currently, wearing fur is just for fashion and is cruel.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thisisways/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Ways_officiel\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/waysofficiel\nBandCamp: https://waysofficiel.bandcamp.com/releases\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/waysofficiel/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Death Row\"\n \nI come to life, I wish i could just live my life I'm taken to a corridor, I think I can walk, breathe, freely, The door is closed behind me, I believe in a game full of life and joy But the people around me Don't seem to want to play with me. My neighbors, day after day, Are caught, The cages emptied and filled, The door is closed behind me, I believe in a game full of life and joy I live in a few centimeters, The day comes, they take me out of my cage, Finally freedom, Finally, you attach me, You take away my life, my skin, You cut me off, I still breathe, I bleed, you take me and throw me The door is closed behind me, I believe in a game full of life and joy My life for a piece of your coat, I suffocate, I suffer, You know it and you continue to wear me All this will change For me, for you.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pGhTIGSN6Bw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pGhTIGSN6Bw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pGhTIGSN6Bw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pGhTIGSN6Bw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pGhTIGSN6Bw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":342,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pGhTIGSN6Bw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/uYdPonBJ7eDl1x2TA6jeZOlP3v4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmRGaTlVZm5HckN3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-09T04:00:30.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Bounce - \"Bounce\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.TranqTV.com - Bounce - \"Bounce\" - Like this video?

The band was founded in 2012. The band pretends to present allegories to the world of written literature, and art in general, and the reflection of those in our real life. \nIn 2017 La Obra de Marte have been through some line up changes, so they released the E.P. titled “La Cara” (translated in English to “The Face” or “The Head”). This is just the first part of what was firstly intended to be a second full length album that was going to be titled “las Dos Caras de La Moneda (The Two Sides of The Medal (Coin)) making reference to the same Spanish saying which implies that every story has more than one side (perspective). During he recording of this E.P. LODM consisted of Emmanuel Rivera Santiago, Jowy Berríos, and Ito Figueroa on Drums. The recorded the full E.P. in Highway Studios (Arecibo) with Alexis Pérez. After the recording sessions the drummer at the moment Ito Figueroa parted ways with the band in good terms. So the band reformed with three new band members: AJ Rivera (Drums), Pete Holliday (Guitar), and Hilmaris Sepúlveda (Bass), jointed with the original members of the band Jowy Berrios and Emmanuel Rivera. \nThe band is at the moment in the pre-production process for the second part of Las Dos Caras de La Moneda, which is going to be titled “La Cruz” (or in literal English which translated means “The tail” of a coin, or “the shield side of the coin”).\n\nDirector Name: Jimmy García - Second Take Media\nProducer Name: Jimmy García - Second Take Media\n\nAbout the Video: The video is for the first track in the E.P. called “Ciclos”. The lyrical content of the song speaks about the infinite cyclical concept of life, The repetition of situations, the leaving, the arrivals, the farewells, the welcomes. It all runs in cycles. \n \nArtist Website: http://www.laobrademarte.com \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/laobrademarte\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/laobrademarte\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/laobrademarte \nBandCamp: https://laobrademarte.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/laobrademarteoficial\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/laobrademarteband \n\nSong Lyrics: \"Ciclos\"\n\nTodo corre en ciclos \nTodo gira en espiral \nFinales e inicios todo corre en ciclos\n \nOtra vez Empiezo \nlo que terminé \nPor nada pararé. \nDesaprender y aprender \nA levantarse al caer \nHasta el fin entender \nQue lo que hoy tal vez puede faltar \nMañana ha de sobrar. \nHay que creer para llegar \nComo un Sol reiniciar. \n \nTodo corre en ciclos \nTodo gira en espiral \nFinales e inicios todo corre en ciclos \n \nEsta vez \nTermino lo que empezé \nPor nadie esperaré. \nDesvanecer y aparecer \nMucho mas fuerte que ayer. \nHasta al fin comprender \nQue lo que hoy tal vez puede sangrar \nMañana ha de sanar. \nHay que perder para ganar. \nComo un Fenix reencarnar. \nTodo corre en ciclos \nTodo gira en espiral \nFinales e inicios todo corre en ciclos \n \nTodo corre en ciclos Todo gira en espiral \nFinales e inicios todo correeeeeeee. \n \nTodo corre en ciclos \nTodo gira en espiral \nFinales e inicios todo corre en ciclos \nCorre en ciclos Corre en ciclos.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nj75bcjiFUY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nj75bcjiFUY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nj75bcjiFUY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nj75bcjiFUY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nj75bcjiFUY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":344,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Nj75bcjiFUY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ZxxMUvl7uO-FbYBpWBLFnvSMHVg\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm1EMFk4SURvOEE4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-08T20:47:48.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Stags - \"This Love\" The Secret Warehouse of Sound","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Stags - \"This Love\" - Like this video?

Barbe has been referred to as having the most widespread influence of any single person in the Athens, GA music scene due to his involvement with so many different artists and projects over the years, from his start playing with noise damaged groups like Mercyland, Bar-B-Q Killers, and Buzz Hungry in the 1980s and '90's; to his stint as bassist in Sugar (Bob Mould's legendary post-Husker Du band), with whom he toured the globe many times and released three classic records; to his work as an engineer/producer on hundreds of albums, including those by Deerhunter, Drive-By Truckers, The Glands, Son Volt, New Madrid, Bettye LaVette, Harvey Milk and Muuy Biien. Many of these were recorded at his Athens based Chase Park Transduction studio. The album's first track, \"Portuguese Door,\" got its premiere on Consequence of Sound. \n\"10th of Seas\" marks a departure for Barbe in that he performed and recorded the entire thing by himself, playing all the instruments, all recorded to analog tape at Chase Park Transduction.\n\"I wanted this record to be as close to the original source of inspiration as possible,\" Barbe says. \"I tried recording some of the songs with other people involved a few times, and it was better in some ways, but always seemed something was lost in translation. The communication became less personal. I felt like the emotional gravy is the glue, so I reverted to working like I did when I was teenager making 4-tracks. Working fast. More feeling it. Less over-thinking it.\"\nAlbum highlights include: \"Portuguese Door,\" slippery and melodically complex, and the opening burst of \"Dim Bulbs,\" the lyrics of which contain the album's title. \"10th of Seas\" is a reference to exploring the outer reaches of one's mind.\nBarbe says: \"The phrase 'sailing the seven seas' did not mean just crossing the known bodies of water, but to go around the world and back. To sail across the 10th of Seas would indicate traversing through the unknown, to have seen it all, and then some.\"\nBarbe will tour America this summer and fall in support of the album backed by Inward Dream Ebb, the alter ego of Athens-based psych-rockers New Madrid, with whom Barbe has produced several albums.\n\nDirector Name: Taylor Chicoine\nProducer Name: David Barbe\n\nAbout the Video: Half-drunk, multi-cultural dance party\n\nArtist Website: http://www.davidbarbe.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/david.barbe.58\nInstagram: turfballer\n\nLabel Name: Orange Twin Records\nLabel Website: http://www.orangetwin.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Why You Gotta Make it So Hard?\"\n\n©2017 David Barbe\nChunderman Music, BMI\nAdmin by BMG Chrysalis\n \nWhy you gotta make it so hard for everyone?\nWhy you gotta make it so hard for yourself?\n \nYou’re keeping everything rolling\nToo many balls in the air\nI just want to know\nWhy you gotta make it so hard all the time. \n \nYou were only enforcing the rules for everyone\nIt’s not the kind of thing you do for yourself\n \nYou’re keeping everything rolling\nToo many balls in the air\nI just want to know\nWhy you gotta make it so hard all the time. \n \nI don’t need you to kick down my door\nI don’t want to get thrown through my tv anymore\nSo I wrote you a chorus\n \nThrow me up against the wall for everyone \nThrow me up against the wall one more time\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YEzZKUsjp20/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YEzZKUsjp20/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YEzZKUsjp20/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YEzZKUsjp20/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YEzZKUsjp20/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":352,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YEzZKUsjp20"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/sOs9q8FlETxl1Al2oy-b229qRFA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkItaVN1YnlUNHhr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-06T23:44:09.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Phrenia - \"Invisible\" Nocturne Records - Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Phrenia - \"Invisible\" - Like this video?

They covered pop songs from the beginning in a more heavier sense. What they wanted to accomplish with this is to bring together the lovers of electronic and metal music and subculture.\nIn March of 2013, Phrenia finally became a full band. They’ve started to write their first original songs and also continued to record pop/metal covers.

His honest lyrics stick a middle finger up to today's society. With gigs across his hometown in venues such as Nambucca, The Monarch and The Half Moon, this rising star is already gathering quite a following. \nEliot released his debut single 'We Always Sail at Night' through MadMan Records in late 2017. It received wide coverage being played on Radio Stations such as RKC, FreshNet and 365. His follow up single ’Weak’ showed a darker side to his music and fans waited in anticipation for the release of his double EP ‘One Step Away from Madness' in early 2018.\nEliot dropped the first part of his debut EP on the 23rd February 2018 and has already begun working with HotVox, BlankTV and BBC Introducing. ‘One Step Away’ is available across all digital media now with Eliot Ash certainly proving he’s more than ‘Just Another Kid Who Knows 4 Chords, Middle Class Cheek Whose Brain Got Bored’.\n\nDirector Name: Jay Maidment\nProducer Name: Eliot Ash\n\nArtist Website: http://www.eliot-ash.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/EliotAshMusic/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/eliotashmusic\nMyspace: https://myspace.com/eliot.ash\nBandCamp: https://eliotash.bandcamp.com/music\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/eliotashmusic/\n\nLabel Name: MadMan Records\nLabel Website: https://tomeliminated.wixsite.com/madmanrecords\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Anxiety\"\n\nKicking it back with my thoughts Biting my nails cos I’m so fucking bored All this time by myself Prescription drugs have done wonders for my health Pacing up and down the stairs Thinking there’s one more but stepping through air Everyone happy out my window But I don't go outside so I wont ever know Does anyone out there feel the same? Cos I’m slowly fading away Does anyone out there have the time for me? Cos in this room I’m loosing my mind for everyone to see Trapped in the sanctum of my prison cell If this place is heaven then outside must be hell But I'm tired of sleep and masturbating Got to get some air cos I am suffocating You can vanish to a pile of ash Resurrect yourself in hell with a can of gas and a match I confess I’m under duress From this stress I digress it’s leading me to a mess Does anyone out there feel the same? Cos I’m slowly fading away Does anyone out there have the time for me? Cos in this room I’m loosing my mind for everyone to see Anxiety Takes ahold of me Oh why can’t you see? That it’s not easy being me I'm stuck in a fucking rut I pop pills to pick me up Oh why can’t you see? It’s not easy being me I’m as vicious as Sid And i’m as immature as a kid Oh why can’t you see?

Their powerful melodies, cut through riffs and aggressive live shows quickly began to resonate across the underground scene. With their second EP \"TRIALS\"(2012)and the release of their video \"Below Ground\"(2013) Headsic began to attract larger crowds and the reviews were promising.\n\"Headsic are meant for greatness\"-Sebastian Zweiniger, Close-up Magazine #140\nHeadsic continued to play numerous clubs and festivals, one being Metaltown Festival with some of the biggest acts in metal(Slipknot, Soilwork, Danzig, Meshuggah).By 2015 two members had exit HEADSIC due to other personal commitments. Despite the setbacks founding members Andreas Ljung(Vocals/Guitar)and Kim Magnusson(Drums) entered the studio and a grueling recording process began.\nIn early 2016, with the addition of the two new members Iffe War(Bass)and Kenta Andersson(Lead Guitar),a collaboration with well-renowned producer Andy La Rocque(King Diamond, Evergrey)was initiated and the EP\"The Crowning\" could be finalized .\nNow with a new line-up and the release of the highly anticipated EP \"The Crowning\" Headsic are back. \n\nDirector Name: Andreas Lindvall and Andreas Mattsson\nProducer Name: PaleHorseInn Productions\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/headsic/ \nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/headsic\nBandCamp: https://headsic.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/headsic/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"The Crowning\"\n\nThe ground is scorched and blackened\nOnly death still lingers here\nPledges made only to be broken\nBehold!

As time went by, the hardcore influences ( 90's / new school) started to become more pronounced, so the songs gained more speed and heaviness. \nIn January 2009 they gave birth to their first \"serious\" release: \"Slow Degradation\", a self-produced EP consisting in 4 songs.\nThe 2011 is the year of the long-awaited first full-length named \"Violence Against Violence\", totally recorded in DO IT YOURSELF way and come out for the indipendent label Audiozero Records. Several concerts around Italy preceded and followed this release, including  a European tour.\nOn 17th April 2014 MUD released their second full-length album called \"FROM THE BOTTOM\", in a DIY style too, recordered and co-produced by indipendent labels.\nConstantly on tour in Italy and in various parts of Europe (including the Kaleidoscope Festival in Tuzla-Bosnia in front of 6000 people), comes to Autumn 2017, where the third \"full album\" comes out of the title \"The Sound Of The Province\", concept album out for the DIY label (created by the band itself) under the name \"THC DIY Productions\" and other Italian DIY labels.\nThe band went through numerous line-up changes over the years, with the exception of the singer Mauro \"AldoHC, the only one who has been in the band since 2004.\nOver the years they have gathered more then 300 gigs in Italy and abroad as well, including performances in hardcore and metal festivals, even sharing stages with important bands, such as Browbeat,Livello Zero,Bloody Riot,Cripple Bastards,Raw Power,Impact,Schizma,Rise Of The Northstar,Entombed,H2O,Discharge,Terror,Expire,Ratos De Porao.\n\nDirector Name: THC DIY Prod\nProducer Name: THC DIY Prod\n\nAbout the Video: This video represents in images what we said in the lyrics of the song, retracing a very sad moment of our last year. However we decided to joke a little with the accident scenes, putting some extreme pyrotechnical car crashes, just to lighten up the theme. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MuDHC/\nMyspace: https://myspace.com/mud04\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/mud04\nBandCamp: https://italianthrashattack.bandcamp.com/album/mud-the-sound-of-the-province-cd-digipack-2017\nInstagram: Instagram.com/thcdiyprod/\n\nLabel Name: THC DIY Prod \nLabel Website: https://www.facebook.com/THCDIYPROD/ \n\nSong Lyrics: \"The Thin Line (Between Life and Death)\"\n\nto exceed that threshold it's too easy for us \nit's easy...how to breathe\nto exceed that limit has been too brutal\nit's easy...how to breathe\nto hope in the awakening looking at you\nit's brutal...It's how to eat shit\nto hope in your breath,in a new life,\nin a new smile...It's how to eat shit\n\nthe thin line between life and death\n\na victim of a privilege and you in the other part...\nit's easy...how to breathe\ninjustice and fast death in my wounded mind\nit's easy...how to breathe\nto hope in the awakening looking at you\nit's brutal...It's how to eat shit\nto hope in your breath,in a new life,\nin a new smile...\nthe thin line between life and death!!!!\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBbqL2-CIf4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBbqL2-CIf4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBbqL2-CIf4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBbqL2-CIf4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBbqL2-CIf4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":367,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"XBbqL2-CIf4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/WXVbO8j8T413XSz0QvSx_mu5iEs\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlpnR3dsQ3Z6NFVF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-02T14:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Los Reverb - \"3:33am\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Los Reverb - \"3:33am\" - Like this video?

While sporting both, a hardcore and a metal socialization the self proclaimed collective has perfectly combined fierce melodic black metal and brutal but yet metallic hardcore crust with angry and critical social political lyrics. With two albums and a huge amount of highly acclaimed EP's and splits under their belt on labels such as Vendetta Records, Alerta Antifascista, Supreme Chaos Records or Halo of Flies, ANCST have been praised by both the international music press as well as HC kids and metal heads alike. After transforming into a full-grown live band in 2014, ANCST has appeared on festivals such as Fluff Fest, Bloodshed Fest, Swamp Fest or the New Noise Fest and has been touring the European mainland as well as the UK relentlessly.\nAs of August 2017 ANCST has teamed up with legendary German label Lifeforce Records for their upcoming album 'Ghosts of the Timeless Void' that is scheduled for March, 2018. \n\nDirector Name: Tumult Fimproduktion\nProducer Name:  Tumult Fimproduktion \n\nArtist Website: http://www.ancstcollective.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/angstnoise/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ancstcollective\nBandCamp: https://angstnoise.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ancstcollective/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/ancst\n\nLabel Name: Lifeforce Records\nLabel Website:  http://www.lifeforcerecords.com \n\nSong Lyrics: \"Dying Embers\"\n\nbeyond the flesh that keeps us captive there's an empty place that feeds our nothingness. the sound of your voice echoes through my veins, no more togetherness, our world laid to waste. I can see us drifting in a sea of hate. torn apart and cramped into empty space. the world keeps turning, gear in gear. lifeless and mourning, trapped in our still lifes. hearts filled with scorn, at the peak of our hollowness. we wander this torn and bleak vacuum in search for deliverance. nowhere to go and nowhere to settle. locked in these restless vessels, our realm is the emptiness. adnate with the end, lost in expiration. ghosts of yesterdays, I only worship my own decay. Connected but torn apart, we devour each other. Pragmatic and untrusting, futile in our own domain.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PLVyD47arHU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PLVyD47arHU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PLVyD47arHU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PLVyD47arHU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PLVyD47arHU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":376,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"PLVyD47arHU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/smWGzqPlMo5LxwyH_PhtoWBk0a8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkJRRGQ5RklsdXp3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-01T00:48:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Fragment - \"Departures\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Fragment - \"Departures\" - Like this video?

Influenced by Protest The Hero, Periphery, Paul Gilbert, Sithu Aye and Intervals, THE DEAD CENTURIES can easily hold their heads up in such exalted company.\n\nComposing and performing technically precise instrumental progressive metal, THE DEAD CENTURIES are rich in virtuosity, melody, compositional skills, and most importantly...they create superb music to listen to. This isn’t the sound of three musicians showing off their undoubted skills, rather they are serving their songs above all else, with every fibre of their beings, every neuron firing in their minds, every tendon in their bodies. In a sense it is as if the three musicians that make up THE DEAD CENTURIES have become one mind in their own music.\n\nDirector Name:  Robyn Njui \nDirector Link: http://njuiphotography.com\n \nAbout the Video: Track three from the debut album 'RACE AGAINST TIME'.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.thedeadcenturies.net/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedeadcenturies/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/deadcenturies\nBandCamp: https://thedeadcenturies.bandcamp.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQCo-kfO8b11j-WHgCqdkCg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedeadcenturiesband/\nContact: thedeadcenturies@gmail.com\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yKMueu1-09A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yKMueu1-09A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yKMueu1-09A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yKMueu1-09A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yKMueu1-09A/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":378,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"yKMueu1-09A"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/-qIyUCHMNc_tywFaSH1Mo6hre-M\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkdOcUNEN2dIMGlv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-27T23:10:32.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Red Cain - \"Snakebouquet\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Red Cain - \"Snakebouquet\" - Like this video?

At its helm is the idiosyncratic and evocative songwriting of Michelle Lecnik and the creative interplay between Steve Martens (drums) and Joey Penner (bass, vocals). The musical arrangements are cinematic and percussive, blending styles of punk, indie rock and prog, with elements of folk and 90's rock nostalgia. Charged by the whims of satire, playfulness and deeply heartfelt emotion, Trampoline explores the highs and lows of the human experience and has you bouncing while they do.\n\nDirector Name: Landon Lake\nProducer Name: Trampoline\n\nAbout the Video: song was recorded and mastered by John Paul Peters at Private Ear studio and the video was directed by Landon Lake. \nMichelle (songwriter) conceived this song in tandem with a music video concept that depicts a common struggle; the struggle to reconnect with the heart after taking refuge in the intellect as a form of self protection. Having shut down emotionally as a young child, the process of re-integrating her intellect with her feelings was a horrific journey for her, as she spent much of her life panic-ridden, sleep deprived and isolated. With the aid of a few “soul mate” connections and therapeutic endeavours along the way, Michelle gradually thawed out the trauma she carried and discovered it could be released. This song is in effect a call to embrace the support of human connection, feel your feelings, and celebrate the possibility of becoming comfortably vulnerable again. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.trampolinetheband.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/trampolinetheband\nBandCamp: http://www.trampolinesounds.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/trampolinetheband\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Twins on Fire\"\n\nthere is a place where we can go\n\nI am a snake, I am a snake, my generosity is fake!\n\nthere is a place where we can go\n\nI am an ape, I am an ape, my future mind may be at stake!\n\nwhere we can go x2\n\nand it's not very far from here x2\n\nI am awake, I am awake, and I stay up I stay up late!\n\nit's not far away from here\n\nI love my friends, I love my friends, I love my friends, I love my friends!\n\nwhere we can go x2\n\nthere's a story of a sweet boy and a sweet girl, and they're dancing to the same song with blindfolds on. he's really good, as is she, but they're a little crazy like you and like you and like me. long story short, they never meet because with their blindfolds on it's hard to see. \n\nbut they keep on dancing. \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXy-vugqIUM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXy-vugqIUM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXy-vugqIUM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXy-vugqIUM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXy-vugqIUM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":381,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xXy-vugqIUM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/092FDwpAeLRHhgniv-lJ-necTes\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LllPN0F5bko1Nndz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-27T21:51:41.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Subwaste - \"Ghost of You and Me\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Subwaste - \"Ghost of You and Me\" - Like this video?

Why can’t you be cool?\nI wanted them to be wrong but they called it.\nAnd when you’re bent you’re a long time falling \nto the bottom of the pit you dig with a smile cause\n\nChorus\nYou’re hearing sirens and think they’re calling you home but they’re swallowing whole all your ships of friends and second chances\nSilence pretense of no self-control. You’ll never learn how to roll or repair all these unmended fences.\n\nVerse\nComing back from short attacks of beer fits lost it’s charm after the first three times.\nHow can I make it clear? \nYou can’t get by trading venom for cheer. I swear I never wanted it to end like this in a song but \n\nChorus\nYou’re hearing sirens and think they’re calling you home but they’re swallowing whole all your ships of friends and second chances\nSilence pretense of no self-control. You’ll never learn how to roll or repair all these unmended fences.\n\nBridge\nSirens (Sirens)\nSirens (Sirens)\n\nChorus\nSirens are calling you home but they’re swallowing whole all your ships of friends and second chances\nSilence pretense of no self-control.

Forgotten we're in a land not of our own. Built an empire over graves and called it our home. \"We've been deceived to believe that we're at the bottom.\" So tell me, why do you look so surprised I keep swinging out of darkness, yet I feel fine? The worlds a bitter cold place at night. I hope you ask yourself tossing and turning, who am I? Even though I know I could sit patiently. Although unlike you patience is no virtue to me.

Comprised of individuals from various musical projects at the end of 2011, when the world was believed to be coming to an end, Hitting Subset had just begun. Seeing a disconnect between the pop/punk scene and the post hardcore scene in Austin, the band formed a new sound hoping to bridge the gap and show listeners the best of both worlds. The vocals are edgy yet controlled, while the lyrics are deep and meaningful. The guitar work leads you on a journey from start to finish with some not-so-typical chords and time signature changes that keep you guessing and wanting more. The bass is present and full bringing you that steady rhythm, occasionally even taking complete control of the melody with some face-melting licks. The drums, not to be out-done by any means, are the driving force. Setting the tone from the beginning, the drums are loud and proud and bring the energy. Hitting Subset will grab you and take you on.\n\nDirector Name: Myka Dylan\nProducer Name: Myka Dylan\n\nArtist Website: http://www.hittingsubset.com \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hittingsubset \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HittingSubset\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/hittingsubset\nBandCamp: https://hittingsubset.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hitting_subset/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/45XFZsXpdUE6RRvqjVxhZQ\n\nSong Lyrics \"Swim\"\n\nThe day it began\nThe lion and the lamb\nIt wasn't the plan\nBut no one ever sticks to them\n\nJanuary flew by\nDidn't get the moon right\nSo unsuspected\nArrows deflecting\n\nStarted with a white lie\nSpiraled into bright lights\nfelt undeserving\nHelpless unnerving \nYou covered our eyes \nSailed through the night\nDreamed of satellites \nSlipped out of sight\nNot out of mind\nUnder darker skies\n\nAnd all your lies\nYou stalled for time\nYou were never coming back\n\nI followed you in\nA temporary son\nYou covered my skin\nFor moments I felt love again\nFebruary flew by\nFound you with a new guy\nSo unsuspected\nHearts were connecting\n\nStarted with a white lie\nSpiraled into bright lights\nfelt undeserving\nHelpless unnerving \nYou covered our eyes \nSailed through the night\nDreamed of satellites \nSlipped out of sight\nNot out of mind\nUnder darker skies\n\nAnd all your lies\nYou stalled for time\nYou were never coming back\nAnd all your lies\nYou stalled for time\nYou were never coming back to me\nBack you me\nYou were never coming back to me\nBack to me\n\nMy compass is shattered it points me to you\nMy ship in the harbor you're blocking the view\n\nAnd all your lies\nYou stalled for time\nYou were never coming back to me\nBack to me\nComin atcha \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rA_cxFrP-jc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rA_cxFrP-jc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rA_cxFrP-jc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rA_cxFrP-jc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rA_cxFrP-jc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":391,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rA_cxFrP-jc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/LxYmik-au46OWOd5WFDG52hSSTk\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkI0VnRib3dteFRj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-22T12:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Defallen Prophecy - \"You\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Defallen Prophecy - \"You\" - Like this video?

What goes around always comes around.You’ve got nothing to hold on to, nothing to pray for. You’ve got no one to trust and nowhere to hide.You cheated on someone who loved you, d’you know it’s like to cheat twice? Maybe you are used to fool people but, bae, not this time. You ask to forgive, you ask to forget, you ask to believe. You’re asking again. You ask to forgive, you ask to forget, you ask to believe. Write now your farewell!\nYou should be ashamed of everything you’ve done. The pain you brought, the hearts you broke.Life’s too short to waste time with you. I got it now, it’s better late than never. You will take your way and I’ll take mine, it’s time to say: “Goodbye for a lifetime”.\nLife’s too short to waste time with you, I got it now, better late than never.

Not content to sit on these songs as just a project, Luke moved forward quickly to enlist some help in getting the band off the ground. Jess came through luck, a meeting via Facebook. Michael a mutual friend of both Luke and Jess joined shortly after. Chem the final piece came sometime later. The boys all known to each other found it hard to practice due to being spread across the state, but due to technology they grew the band with the help of home recordings. \nPostscript are a hard working band already in their first year playing all over Australia, happy to jump in their car and drive four hours to play to anyone who will listen. Their self-titled debut album with influences from the 90's skate punk scene is now ready to go, be sure to check them out! \n\nDirector Name: Jess Cuman\nProducer Name: Jess Cuman\n\nAbout the Video: Lyric Video\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/postscriptmelbourne\nBandCamp: http://www.postscriptmelbourne.bandcamp.com\n\nLabel Name: Dead Memory Records\nLabel Website: http://www.deadmemoryrecords.bandcamp.com\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtULyoQo0m8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtULyoQo0m8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtULyoQo0m8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtULyoQo0m8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtULyoQo0m8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":395,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BtULyoQo0m8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/WtG5Jtb_aVqwZbc24vNFhfQg-iA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlRBQ2dIb3dCbE0w","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-21T12:05:38.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Marla Singer - \"Killing Arcadia\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Marla Singer - \"Killing Arcadia\"\" - Like this video?

Their debut single “Padlock” is set to release on February 20th with two other songs currently in production for release later this year.

The band was formed in 2009 and the following year released their first EP entitled, “Maybe This Will Start the Fire”, which set the sound and style that Cardio Kazan was striving for. The different influences that vary from Hardcore to Pop were captured in the essence of this EP. In 2011, the band released their second EP, 'Ultraviolet Suspension', which shows a more aggressive sound, yet melodic and complex. “Ultraviolet Suspension”, also allowed the band to ventured into their first tour. \nCardio Kazan has been able to establish themselves as a prominent talent in the local scene capturing the attention of audiences not familiar to this music genre. 'The Baralax' is the band's first length album, which offers a more complex and technical music, but keeping their original sound as the foundation of this album. \n \nAbout the Video: This video is a representation of the constant fights we face with our demons. The celestial clock has been part of the band's history since our first album. In the video, we are the clock, it is our essence and what represents us. \n\nThe four black monks represent our individual demons that tried to achieve our dreams and do what we love in life \n\nThe four members of the band share a common demon as a band And it follows us in every single step we take together.\n\nA never ending fight for equilibrium\n \nDirector Name: EDER FARREL HORTA\nDirector Link: \n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CardioKazan/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/CardioKazan\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Avia Zophia\"\n\nPLEASE FORGIVE ME, UNLIGHTED,\nI'VE BEEN CARRIED AWAY..\nAWAY FROM YOUR SINS..\nI'VE BEEN FORCED TO USE SO MUCH DIFFERENT FACES\n\nTHE CLAIRVOYANT IN ME \nHAS BEEN CARRIED AWAY\nDRIFTED AWAY, BY THE WIND\n\nAND EVERYTIME THAT I SEE MYSELF IN THE MIRROR..\nMY SHADOWS SUDDENLY PLEDGE TO ME\nAM I WORTHY OF YOUR DISGUISE?\nAM I STILL WORTHY TO WEAR THE MASK ?\n\nMY MISCONCEPTIONS, MY DARKEST FEARS\nMY ONLY PHOBIA HAS BECOME REAL !\n\nTHE ELIXIR FADES IN MY HANDS\nMY FEELINGS CHANGE AND IM TRAPPED IN CELESTIAL FORMS\n\nI'VE LISTEN TO THE VOICES\nSURROUNDING AT THE BREAK OF DAWN\nI'M THE PROPHET OF MY OWN DEMISE\nSAVIOR OF MY OWN \n\nI'VE LISTEN TO THE VOICES\nAM I STILL WORTHY TO WEAR THE MASK?\n\nAM I WORTHY OF YOUR DISGUISE?\nTHE MASK I WEAR OUT IN PLAIN SIGHT\nUNLIGHTED, DON'T LEAVE ME ASIDE\nCELESTIAL CLOCK DON'T CHANGE YOUR TIME\n\nMY MISCONCEPTIONS, MY DARKEST FEARS, MY ONLY PHOBIA HAS BECOME REAL.\n\nI'VE LISTEN TO THE VOICES\nSURROUNDING AT THE BREAK DAWN\nI'M THE PROPHET OF MY OWN DEMISE\nSAVIOR OF MY OWN\n\nI'VE LISTEN TO THE VOICES\nSURROUNDING AT THE BREAK DAWN\nI'M THE PROPHET OF MY OWN DEMISE\nSAVIOR OF MY OWN\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDz3ZZ2ZTYg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDz3ZZ2ZTYg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDz3ZZ2ZTYg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDz3ZZ2ZTYg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDz3ZZ2ZTYg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":399,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"aDz3ZZ2ZTYg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/i9YVgP-jORSsXz0jRR1_X8vWL_A\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmVVVEt2SmM5NVk0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-20T04:11:46.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"After Burner - \"Feast of Fools\" Riffbear Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - After Burner - \"Feast of Fools\" - Like this video?

Weesp music is about finding individuals own path in the endless sea, about hard choices, about dreams and passion, about being different.\nThey describe their music as Alternative Post Metal \nLex (vocals), Mike (guitar) and Mi (bass) started playing music together in school in 2003. \nAfter recording the second EP 'Taste of Steel' in 2009, the band has finally announced its name - WEESP.\nBy the beginning of work on the next EP (in 2011) - 'This Will Destroy Us', two more band members - Gul (drums) and Mi's twin brother Stak (electronics) joined the team, to finalize the current structure of WEESP.\nIn 2015 the band released their first long play album 'The Void', produced by the Wieslawski Brothers at Hertz Records (Behemoth, Decapitated, Vader). The album was released August 20, 2015 and features 13 songs, two singles done in collaboration with Cory Brandan from Norma Jean.\nNow Weesp is working on the second album 'Black Sails' coming out early 2018, also produced by the Wieslawski Brothers.\nDuring the album promo campaign Weesp started to name their fans community as Black Sails, and each fan individually as sailor. The ‘Black Sails’ album will stand against the pressure of the society against people who choose to be different, against witch hunting and mass cultural dictatorship. \n\nBand Members:\nAlexey \"Lex\" Falco - vocals, keyboards (piano);\nMichael \"Mike\" Zalutskiy - guitar;\nDzmitry \"Mi\" Budzko - bass guitar, keys;\nStanislav \"Stak\" Budzko – keys;\nAlexei \"Gul\" Galesnik - drums.\n\nDirector Name: Pavel Ignatovich\nDirector Link: https://www.facebook.com/pavel.ign\n \nAbout the Video: Accompanying video was filmed during 2017 on summer festivals and \"Black Sails\" tour which took place in Belarus, Ukraine, Poland and Germany.\n\n“Not Over” is about the endless struggle with darkness. With the darkness that lives inside each of us. And in the end it’s about accepting that darkness,coexisting with it, controlling it, making friends with it. That is what gives us strength not to get crazy in that world. That is what makes us black sails.\n \nArtist Website: http://www.weespofficial.com/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/weespband\nMyspace: https://myspace.com/weespband\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bandweesp\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/weespwilldestroyus\nLastFM: https://www.last.fm/music/Weesp\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/weesp\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/weespband\nBandCamp: https://weesp.bandcamp.com/\nTumblr: http://weespband.tumblr.com/\nPureVolume: http://www.purevolume.com/weesp\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/weespband/\n \nLabel Name: Zeppelin Records\nLabel Website: https://www.facebook.com/zeppelinrecordsby/\n \nSong Lyrics:  \"Not Over\"\n\nThen something hits \nFrenzied at the ribs\nFrom inside \nTearing me apart\n\nAs if the world\nGone wild \nAll I left behind \nBurning my heels \n\nI am the one \nOne responsible \nUpgrade available \n\nIt’s such a thin line \nThe line turns into \nA point of no return \n\nThis game \nMy game is still not over\nSo confident and sharp \nLike a razor\nAs if you have control\nAs if you had control ever\nSo confident and sharp \n\nPull me into darkness \nTurn off the control \nAnd fade\nDevoured by the shadows \nDeeper into darkness \nОut of the control\nI'll get up from my knees\nAnd pounce on a throat \n\nThis fight \nMy fight is still not over \nSo confident and sharp\nLike a razor \nAs if you have control \nAs if you had control ever \nSo confident and sharp\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzBilUZ6w9E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzBilUZ6w9E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzBilUZ6w9E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzBilUZ6w9E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzBilUZ6w9E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":405,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"KzBilUZ6w9E"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/RY-ZCH-ryOE-z605ZEbBySvzhKo\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnYwajFoNjRVd2dr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-18T18:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Uncouth - \"Just a Matter of Time\" Teenage Heart Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Uncouth - \"Just a Matter of Time\" - Like this video?

I caught a hot one today. I saw The Pogues sing here in Boston “a freeborn man of the USA.” Yes we all are the festival. Sell off my bones. I want to watch you watching a dead man walking alive in a field of gold. What is reason? What is the thing that I want? I’m out here looking for someone. You’re already at home, and in bed, and in love. Give me all of the holidays you shared. I would’ve reached back down in the leeches to bring back the week when I cared. Blood. Breathe. Bring me the sea, and the treasure it holds. I want to know life below deck, pulling on oars. What is the reason? What is the thing that want? What is the sign of the line of my people and all the things that I’m of.

The result is a mixture of metalcore, djent and progressive influences, with the addition of female clean vocals.\n \nAfter releasing our first EP, named 'EOS', in 2015, a fifth element joined the formation, leading to our current line-up. Together we wrote and self-produced our first full length.\n \nWith “D-Grade” we focused on the emotional impact of the songs. While chasing heavier riffing style, with impactful rhythms, we wanted to enhance the song structures with melancholic melodies, eventually recurring to thick synthesizer lines and orchestral arrangements.\n \nEnd of Skyline is now looking to join forces with a strong label agency for the release and distribution of “D-Grade”.\n \nWe’ve been a hard touring group, performing around Italy and getting to share the stage with the likes of John Macaluso, Pino Scotto, Reality Grey, Cancrena, Shores of Null, BackJumper and others.\n \nWhat’s been said:\n“End of Skyline” was just the perfect thing I need to hear right now, and I’m so glad I came across it.” – FemmeMetalWebzine.net\n“… a blast of groovy metalcore riffs and Milly’s voice immediately captured my heart again.” – MetalTemple.com\n“… The guitar work is outstanding!” – Italia di Metallo.com\n\n\nDirector Name: MANUELA NICOLETTI, MILLY FLORIO\nProducer Name: MANUELA NICOLETTI, ALESSANDRO SPENGA\n\nAbout the Video: ‘COLORS’ tells the story of a man lost through the troubles of a lifetime. While he “dances” and moves around, he can see colors changing, as well as his perception of life, making him feel distant from his own perspectives.\nAs he strives seeking for an answer, he finds the Faith wanting to help him.\nThe man isn’t able to quit, but he understands his destiny, so the Faith helps bring him to the conclusion of his suffering.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/endofskylineband/\nBandCamp: https://endofskyline.bandcamp.com/releases\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVBKoGXq6n7aHgF61u_iVg\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Colors\"\n \nWhen the compromise becomes the only way to live…\n \nLook at this tears\nseen every time\nall your life is compromised\nwhen you're looking around you know \nyou cannot fail\nbreathing in this heavy atmosphere\nchecking the guns\nwhat is done is done\n \nwhile you dance around\ndon't look down\nor you will fall\n \nWhile you dance around \nthe perspective changes\nand dancing you going down\n \nthe compromise is yours\nthe fate arrived\nand won\nand you lose\n \nwhile we dance around\ndon't look down\nor we will fall\n \nWhile you dance around \nthe perspective changes\nand dancing you going down\n \nwhile you dance around\nthe perspective changes\nand dancing you’re going down\nthe colors never failed\nand then\nand dancing we’re going down\nthe future in our hands\nmeanwhile we fight\nto get a better life, \nwe know that the world will never change…\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRczxTfPx-E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRczxTfPx-E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRczxTfPx-E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRczxTfPx-E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRczxTfPx-E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":411,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qRczxTfPx-E"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/UrSPD3rtNco3a9ozRQrr6ebZBOg\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkRrYzA1bEczZnJr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-15T22:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Joe Taylor Must Die - \"West 2 / When It Rains\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Joe Taylor Must Die - \"West 2 / When It Rains\" - Like this video?

Drifting slowly.\nI think I lost the blood in my veins, somethings wrong with my brain.\nNever knowing.\nIf everything gets better in the end. Why do I feel burning in my skin.\nI haven’t seen the sun for days.\nThen it rains.\n\nNow I see all my ropes have been frayed , nothings holding in place.\nEver going.\nI feel I’ve grown cold in my face , must be part of my fate.\nNow it showing.\nThey always say that I’m suppose to carry on, there’s no turning back when underneath the pond.\nI feel it drying out and breathe.\nThen it rains.\n\nTell me when it’s over now.\nAll my bones have turned to dust again, fill my blood with medicine.\nIs anybody listening now?\nCause I just lost my fucking brain. And everything that meant the most to me.\n\nJust when I think the air can’t get much colder. I think maybe I’ll be better in the warmth.\nI think it’s time to take a trip down to Arizona. So I can dry out both my lungs again before it all comes flooding in when it rains\n\nTell me when it’s over now. All my bones have turned to dust again. Fill my blood with medicine. Is anybody listening now? Cause I just lost my fucking brain. And everything that meant the most to me.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dkc05lG3frk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dkc05lG3frk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dkc05lG3frk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dkc05lG3frk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dkc05lG3frk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":412,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Dkc05lG3frk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/jlryp-PR-Uy-DoSDYQlmPOk9rFA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmszUzdYX0xjNkQ0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-17T02:00:25.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Last Man Standing UK - \"Carry Me Through\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Last Man Standing UK - \"Carry Me Through\" - Like this video?

Drawing on influences that range from the 70’s grandeur of Pink Floyd and Rush to more down-to-earth modern post-rockers like Mogwai and Battles,\n\nJim Griffin and Dave Tobin provide a swirling haze of expansive dual guitars, fried by multiple layers of electronica, and occasionally shot through by solos that owe as much to Guns ‘n’ Roses as they do to King Crimson. All of this six-string excess is anchored firmly in place by Brian Fitzgerald and Brendan Miller’s bone-rattling rhythm section that plant you back in their heavy rock foundations of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.\n\nDirector Name: Stephen Boland\nProducer Name: Stephen Boland\n\nAbout the Video: A psychedelic video with a level of ambiguity and overall delicious strangeness equaled only by the track itself..\n\nArtist Website: https://zombiepicnic1.bandcamp.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZombiePicnic/\nTwitter: @zombiepicnicire\nBandCamp: https://zombiepicnic1.bandcamp.com/\n\nLabel Name: Golden Shred Records\n\nSong Lyrics:\n(SPOKEN)\nWow\nThat was a lot to get off your chest\nThank you for sharing\nEven those bits about your mother's hip surgery were really fascinating\n\nNow I'm going to cure you\nDo you believe me?\n\nBe aware of pickpockets, don't carry your wallet in your rear pocket\n\nYou had so much anger in storage\nBut now we're denying it together\nIt's a big step forward\n\nThe next step is three steps\nIt's as simple as \"A.B.C.\"\nDo you think you can handle that?\nNo?\nGood.\nHere we go...\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8Bh-nq3_n4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8Bh-nq3_n4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8Bh-nq3_n4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8Bh-nq3_n4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":418,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"A8Bh-nq3_n4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ZphnoLLGUS4XBmSDz0g8uUv6xQY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmN1U3J3RmpLSUNj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-15T22:45:02.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Hammerstroke - \"Now You Die\" DocRock Music Records","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Hammerstroke - \"Now You Die\" - Like this video?

The band offers a style focused on Death Metal sound, surrounded however by many other influences, combining driven and dynamic riffs with melodic and inspired ones. An effective combination of power and atmosphere which creates a distinctive and varied sound.\nAfter a 4-track demo entitled \"Dehuminazed Society\" (2012) and a change of formation, the group came out with its first full-length \"Logos\" (Splitrick Records, 2017). \nThis album, starting from the Death Metal matrix, goes through all its shapes, creating a strongly personal sound with a marked progressive influence. The lyrics follow the main theme of the Greek philosophical concept of the Logos, a universal law which rules everything through reason and need. In the lyrics, this is related with today's life, in order to analyze the human condition and the events that afflict it.\n \nDirector Name: Simone Dalla Costa\nDirector Link: https://it.linkedin.com/company/sdc-prod?trk=ppro_cprof\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/fateunburied\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmWaK5WKlhbDpmdYW9jj4VQ\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/fateunburied\nBandCamp: https://fateunburied.bandcamp.com/music\n \nLabel Name: Sliptrick Records\nLabel Website: https://sliptrickrecords.com/\n \nSong Lyrics: Cracked into pieces, I know\nThey cannot be wired\nA collection of\nEndless desires\nPiece by piece I try to paste them\nI'm not strong enough\nEverything crumbles again\nI give it up\n\nReliance on rationality\nBut the mind does not lie in the same real world\nThe mood seems to be\nDepend on both at the same time\n\nDespite this I'm\n\nPoised, poised between two opposites of\nMyself, I still stand but I'm afraid \nTo fall, fall from this unstable mental\nStructure, I'm still not the owner of my soul\n\nDisconnected from reality\nThings are going in their own way\nFind myself in state of agony\nUseless in front of this decay\nConfusion reigns on my head\nI'm not the ruler\nThe logic of thought is dead \nThey accept their future\n\nReliance on rationality\nBut the mind does not lie in the same real world\n\nVertigo\n\nPoised, poised between two opposites of\nMyself, I still stand but I'm afraid to \nFall, fall from this unstable \nMental structure, I'm still not the owner of my soul\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Jy4Q_79pbo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Jy4Q_79pbo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Jy4Q_79pbo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Jy4Q_79pbo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Jy4Q_79pbo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":424,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"8Jy4Q_79pbo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/lLPP_oIWcORiPBB-W-tzsR_qwHc\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmNaX1BxTTZIZ1BZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-13T02:48:50.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Leach - \"The Untouchables\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Leach - \"The Untouchables\" - Like this video?

Hailing from NYC, Washington Dc, and West \"By God\" Virginia, the band's sound has come into it's own under the watchful eye of producer/guitarist Brian Bonds. \n       What he had heard was the band's pre-show huddle. A ritual Year of the Locust uses to clear their minds of the day, put aside the rest of the world, and prepare for the show. \nIn early 2017, after his departure from Florida Georgia Line, Brian toured with Tantric alongside Y.O.T.L. The band would forge a friendship with Brian that would ultimately lead to him producing 'Rock. Sex. God. Machine.' later that year, and yielding the single, \"Sunrise.\" \n      Having shared the stage with some musical behemoth's in recent years, the band feels as though it's search for identity has been (temporarily) quenched. Eager to reveal the new beast to the world, the band will have their chance as they kickoff 2018 with a 36 city tour alongside Starset. Add to that a new single/music video release for \"Sunrise\"  and \"The Swarm\" is set for domination in 2018. \n\nDirector Name: Steve Sage\nProducer Name: Brian Bonds\n\nAbout the Video: \"Sunrise is the lead single off our upcoming album/documentary combo, 'Rock. Sex. God. Machine.'  The video and song embody a story of love and revenge.  Sometimes when a relationship hits the point of no return, the only thing you can do is get away from the situation and clear your head.  Sometimes that clear head comes in the form of revenge with another woman.  Either way, you won't be back until Sunrise, there's no stopping you tonight!\"\n\n\"We put the video together after a 20 hour straight drive back to our hometown in NY from Nashville after a grueling three weeks writing, touring and recording Sunrise and a few other new songs for the album.  For a bunch of guys on little to no sleep for the previous several days, we look pretty good, and so do the girls!\"\n\nArtist Website: http://www.yearofthelocust.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/yearofthelocust\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/yearofthelocust\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/yearofthelocust\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Sunrise\"\n\nI can't believe you'd do this to me.

Days after, Taylor met Dan whilst intoxicated outside of Trafalgar Halls and when Taylor found out Dan was a drummer, Anchored In was formed.

Formed in the summer of 2016 after the disbanding of their former pop-punk/post-hardcore band, Lights in the Sky, the two came together to form a band that would best showcase who they are as musicians and thus, Capital North was born. After the split of LITS, Farrar packed his bag and traveled the world for a year on a mission of soul searching while Zichella graduated from culinary school and moved to Portland to pursue his passion as a chef, but both found their way back to one thing; music. Before long, the two began planning the direction of what would be Capital North from separate continents. While traveling in Iceland, Farrar visited a unique and beautiful town called Akureyri, better known as the 'Capital of the North.' Leaving a lasting impression on him, he realized it accurately described the duo's current state of emotions as they strive to get back to what is important with \"capital\" being an integral place or feeling while \"north\" describes the direction in which to get there. As a band, Capital North has created a sound that is a drastic change from their former project and focuses on connecting with listeners through relatable lyrical themes and honest melodies. Recorded at The Pie Studios in Pasadena, the band's debut EP, Sea To Sky, was engineered by Nels Jensen (Sigur Rós, Jamie Foxx) with tracking by Devyn June, and mixed/mastered by Bertrand and Eric Poncet (of Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!) at Alias Studio. The six-track EP is set to be released on March 2nd, 2018 and discusses real life experiences including struggles with health, relationships, life, and death. With the release of Sea To Sky, Capital North looks excitedly toward the future and the potential of making a monumental impact in the music scene and beyond.  \n\nDirector Name: Jesse Lynch (www.iamjesselynch.com)\nProducer Name: Jesse Lynch/Capital North\n\nAbout the Video: “Glass Houses” offers the viewer a cataclysm of storylines all intersecting into one, almost in a Crash type of scenario in order to get the point across – we all make mistakes, and everything is not always as it seems. We had an absolute blast working with Jesse Lynch on writing, directing, and producing this film and could not be more proud of how it came out!\n\nArtist Website: https://www.capitalnorthband.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CapitalNorthCA/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/capitalnorthca\nBandCamp: https://capitalnorth.bandcamp.com \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/capitalnorthca/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Glass Houses\"\n\nAnd I hurt all over my skin\nMy glass house fell to dirt And I don't want to build it again And I heard the sound of the end And I don't want to ever hear it again And I don't want to hear it again And I don't want to hear it again And then I heard what you said, \"These bones are only shallow graves meant for stones to break\" And we've made... Mistakes... they led us to our graves It keeps us so afraid... when we're built just to break It's in our blood, it's in our love, it's in our hate (Andrés) I must admit, I got an addiction to your smooth skin, and that suburban innocence, you twirl you spin, we two-stepped at the park before we sin, no wonder why you wanna, see me again, I don't really care to see you again. And then I heard what you said, \"These bones are only shallow graves meant for stones to break\" And we've made Mistakes... they led us to our graves It keeps us so afraid... when we're built just to break It's in our blood, it's in our love, it's in our hate It's in our blood, it's in our love, it's on our hate. It's in our blood. It's in our love. It's in our blood. It's in our love. It's in our love. It's in our hate.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZJSOCH9E4rI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZJSOCH9E4rI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZJSOCH9E4rI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZJSOCH9E4rI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZJSOCH9E4rI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":432,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ZJSOCH9E4rI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/16ISA-O5grYshaXEpqLm7EM0GXs\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkM4eUpYZGVISWRN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-12T01:01:31.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Cifika - \"Momom\" Third Culture Kids - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.TranqTV.com - Cifika - \"Momom\" - Like this video?

In 2015, Brian Hubbert and Andrew Oakley got together in a barn outside of Boulder, Colorado, to create a type of rock and roll that has been missing in music lately: one with loud, unapologetic attitude, ready to kick ass. In late 2016, the duo relocated to Brooklyn. There, the duo is readying the release of their debut full length album while simultaneously undergoing the process of writing and recording its following up. A Shadow of Jaguar has released two singles to date; \"Mama Needs the Bottle\" in 2015 and \"Keep On Knocking\" in 2016. With an album ready to release, and another on the way, there is a lot in store from this band. \nDuring their short existence, band has toured coast to coast. They have been featured on SiriusXM and has received rave reviews from publications like Live For Live Music, goodmusicallday, Bolderbeat, and more. A Shadow of Jaguar's sound is unique and inimitable, and there is no stopping it. There is only rock and roll.\n\nDirector Name: Aaron Springston\nProducer Name: A Shadow of Jaguar\n\nAbout the Video: Recorded live in one take on a random Tuesday in Brooklyn. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.ashadowofjaguar.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ashadowofjaguar \nTwitter: @ashadowofjaguar\nInstagram: @ashadowofjaguar\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/sh_vx7fwb1g\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n\nThumbs Up, Comment and Subscribe!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DLBwI03fz4s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DLBwI03fz4s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DLBwI03fz4s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DLBwI03fz4s/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DLBwI03fz4s/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":436,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"DLBwI03fz4s"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/uBDpT5HjRXoCwH2IBeaC1IRnans\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Li1DNTdZVDRtd0Nz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-10T21:48:40.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Nate Bohnet - \"Suicidal Illusions\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Nate Bohnet - \"Suicidal Illusions\" - Like this video?

Having lost his parents as a very young child; Nate has truly experienced what he writes about.\n\nNate hopes his album with help and heal his fans as much as it has himself.\n\n“This album is centred around the concept that music is therapy. We all go through times in our lives where nothing seems to make sense, everything is on the edge, and you don’t know what will happen next. We have all loved, laughed, lost, and experienced tremendous grief and joy in our time alive. ‘Therapeutic Destruction’ means harnessing all the negative energy that comes into your life, and unleashing it in music that some might consider destructive. I felt that the title fits the main idea of the album; using music as a way of therapy and harnessing it in such a way as to allow myself to deal with aspects of my life, and if one song reaches you and connects with you; it has done its job. The overarching message is that regardless of all these low points in our lives, all we have to do is push forward and strive. The only thing holding you back is your mind.”\n\nDue out February 16, 2018 for free download, Nate Bohnet’s solo debut album “Therapeutic Destruction” features 14 heart felt heavy tracks all recorded, mixed and mastered with his producer touch at his Medicine Hat, AB based Octave Studios. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/natebohnet/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n\nThumbs Up, Comment and Subscribe!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-C57YT4mwCs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-C57YT4mwCs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-C57YT4mwCs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-C57YT4mwCs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-C57YT4mwCs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":437,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-C57YT4mwCs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/HXmmEra53Uk4O_y1GxnI4NX3_bk\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlVzbXZxaUVrWW9r","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-12T00:39:55.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Kyle Johnson - \"Home in Your Eyes\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.HankTV.com - Kyle Johnson - \"Home in Your Eyes\" - Like this video?

The influences are diverse, incorporating sounds from melodic hardcore and third wave ska, they make it clear from the first moment their tastes for melodies: evident in their vocal trios and horn section.\nAbraskadabra has created a solid fan base and have played all around Brazil. In the U.S., their first tour happened recently. This tour stretched from coast to coast, passing through thirteen states and twenty-one cities shortly after releasing a version of \"Not Your Savior\" (No Use for a Name’s song), which ended up in a documentary about the legendary American label, Fat Wreck Chords.\nDuring these years, Abraskadabra have been always standing ground into relevant concerts, sharing the stage with all these great bands: Bad Religion, Rise Against, Flogging Molly, Fishbone, Streetlight Manifesto, Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, Pauline Black (The Selecters), Goldfinger, The Toasters, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Satanic Surfers, are some to name.\nIt isn’t just the 15-years on the road that settle the power and unity of Abraskadabra, but also the energy and passion they put into the music they create, being friends first and putting together one of the most solid and interesting Brazilian band nowadays.\"\n\nDirected by Guilherme Lepca Production by Smart Diseños (Angelo Utrabo, Axel Giller, Bruno de Lara, Daniel Duda, Guilherme Lepca, Janis Medeiros e Lorayne Claudino) Animation: Axel Giller e Daniel Duda Illustration: Angelo Utrabo e Guilherme Lepca Supported by Whatafuck Hamburgueria Song recorded, mixed and mastered by Thiago Trosso at Brothers Room Audio Recordings (London/UK) \n\nAbout the Video: Official Music Video for Abraskadabra's \"The Dream\" from the new album 'Welcome', to be released on 02/20/2018. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.abraskadabra.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/abrascwb\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abraskadabra\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/abraskadabra\nSPOTIFY: http://spoti.fi/2ArXHjd\nDEEZER: http://bit.ly/2AqMI9v\n\nLabel Name: Independent, so far\n\nSong Lyrics: \"The Dream\"\n\nWhen you try to escape but you go into the wrong door And the world as you know seems so far to see Then you stumble to many blocks and safari dreams, with all these creeps I wonder if it feast me! When you drag yourself alone in the stairway down Feel a little dizzy cause the air is worn out Now open up your eyes and see the heaven Or if you look it up you may as well be in hell What the hell? I’m on a solo dream, but it seems so far from me Take just one step closer To another point of view Crystal clear just like you knew Cut those chains to follow through To that plain point of view It’s like I never dance, but here I am killing the dance floor And the blood is coming up right at my knees Take me away to the bottom of the coldest sea Always wanted to fight creatures down here Oh wait, I’m out without OC I wonder if it kills me! Walking down a little place that reminds me of home But all these little men starring me it’s so cold. Cold! I wonder if I’m dreaming in heaven Cause suddenly I woke up like a stone-cold 1-2-3 come on! I’m feeling strange here All these things are so damn new Meeting different planets. Oh! It’s like I’m on the line of mental illness like I tried Woke up from these cold inside And take control That’s just a dream I had Nothing you should compliment Take non for example and Let it die ‘til we die\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDr_-y-3hkw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDr_-y-3hkw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDr_-y-3hkw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDr_-y-3hkw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDr_-y-3hkw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":441,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"cDr_-y-3hkw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/WdXCHdJaBnU4mhXu6FIu9mazRLM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjZrOFFHZlREWnQw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-09T15:38:24.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Three Kingdoms - \"Serenity\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Three Kingdoms - \"Serenity\" - Like this video?

It’s safe to say, I’ve done my time in the dirty slums I’ve learn how to take the intensity of pain and make it numb No longer scathed by the thoughts of my peers. No longer weak, I'm at my mental peak. I fought to find a way, to reach a heightened state, Ill remain composed along the way I’ve reached the peak of serenity. Close your eyes Exceed the mind With new strength comes unknown power, I'm ready for this I'm always ready for a war. A breeze whispers through the trees, my nerves stay calm just like the leaves, soft wind chimes become the soundtrack of my mind. Just know when you cry, weakness leaves the mind. Ascend to a point where nothing dents the mind. I’ve reached the mental peak.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6k8QGfTDZt0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6k8QGfTDZt0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6k8QGfTDZt0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6k8QGfTDZt0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6k8QGfTDZt0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":442,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6k8QGfTDZt0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/8umV1_JFtA06HgSCzsqao5dBSXw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlBrdGplRzdjTDVR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-09T15:25:16.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Smoke Signals - \"Stranded\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Smoke Signals - \"Stranded\" - Like this video?

Influenced by mid-90's groove metal with elements of classic thrash, Lefutray explores a very intense, heavy and blasting sound. Three albums, two EPs, one live album and several singles also tours in Chile, South America and recently Europe and Russia are some of the more significant achievements of the Chilean band. \n\nDirector Name: Costin Chioreanu\nProducer Name: Lefutray\n\nAbout the Video: The video/single was created by Romanian artist Costin Chioreanu, who worked before with acts such as At The Gates, Mayhem, Grave, Deströyer666, Absu and Vader , among many others.\n“Labyrinth” it’s a glimpse into new Lefutray’s songwriting, more suffocating, heavy and very, very dense. We choose this song because we think it’s the best way to show to the fans of our music a preview of the upcoming work, and how the new songs will mark some kind of difference regarding our previous records” comments Cristian Olivares, guitarist in Lefutray. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.lefutray.cl\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/Lefutray/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/lefutray\nBandCamp: https://lefutray.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lefutray/\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lefutray\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o49A-2vC4-Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o49A-2vC4-Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o49A-2vC4-Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o49A-2vC4-Q/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o49A-2vC4-Q/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":444,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"o49A-2vC4-Q"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/LqACyCbnk4mZMGpQgmuUcDY7PbA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkRHeUtYaHh4cTh3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-08T03:36:06.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Philadelphia Experiment - \"Straight Jacket Arson\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Philadelphia Experiment - \"Straight Jacket Arson\" - Like this video?

Being able to be an anchor of hope and reliance through his passion, energy and lyrical intensity for others who may be stuck in the painful and dark mazes of mental anguish is one of his biggest priorities.  He is quoted as saying,  \"I want people to be able to say 'Because of you, I didn't give up'. In this generation, teens need to know that someone is really there for them and that person legit means it.\"  Corey is currently in the midst of growing his fan base after releasing his first single \"Drop the Anchor\" that features vocalist, producer and guitarist, Michael Waters.\n\nDirector Name: Dawning Media\nProducer Name: Michael Waters\n\nAbout the Video: Lyric video by Dawning Media.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/Corey-Husband-177630896177768/\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/coreyhusband00\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/coreyhusband00\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/VqBIaXHj47U\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Drop the Anchor\"\n\nYou say you need me in your life.\nYour words don't mean shit.\nThat didn't stop your mental knife.\nTake a number and wait in line, I swear I'm done this time.\nI'm still stopping the blood from when you gave me this cut.\nYet I'm the one to blame, I thought we found true love.\nYou never felt the same, never felt the same.\nI thought I knew you, I gave you my heart.\nBut you're no better, you're just like any liar.\nI should've left you to burn in the fire.\nI should've never saved you.\nYou read me like an open book, you told me that you loved me and my hand, you took.\nSo before I say goodbye, fuck you and goodnight.\nFuck you and goodnight.\nI put all my hope and faith in you.\nFaith in you.\nSent us to hell because that's all you know to do.\nI know the truth so don't fucking lie.\nYou're transparent and your words are thin, goodbye.\nGoodbye.\nThis is your darkest sin.\nYou're so stuck in your stupid, little world.\nYou don't see how confused you really are.\nI thought I knew you, I gave you my heart.\nBut you're no better, you're just like any liar.\nI should've left you to burn in the fire.\nI should've never saved you.\nYou read me like an open book, you told me that you loved me and my hand, you took.\nSo before I say goodbye, fuck you and goodnight.\nYou brought me up high and down low.\nYou tore me down and just let go.\nNow I see the only person I need is me.\nI should've seen this coming.\nYou read me like an open book.\nYou told me that you loved me and my hand, you took.\nSo before I say goodbye, fuck you and goodnight.\nOHHHHHH\nI gave you my heart.\nIt tore me apart.\nI gave you my heart.\nIt tore me apart.\nYou left a sour taste.\nMy time was such a waste.\nNever ever again.\nI thought I knew you, I gave you my heart.\nBut you're no better, you're just like any liar.\nI should've left you to burn in the fire.\nI should've never saved you.\nYou read me like an open book, you told me that you loved me and my hand, you took.\nSo before I say goodbye, fuck you and goodnight.\nYou brought me up high and down low.\nYou tore me down and just let go.\nNow I see the only person I need is me.\nI should've seen this coming.\nYou read me like an open book.\nYou told me that you loved me and my hand, you took.\nSo before I say goodbye, fuck you and goodnight.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9aHEGLSx8lk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9aHEGLSx8lk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9aHEGLSx8lk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9aHEGLSx8lk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9aHEGLSx8lk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":446,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9aHEGLSx8lk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/NBJlD4dzG2MTUawO-skXToPqlQY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk5JV25CSENuSUhB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-07T20:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"InZeros - \"Wasted Mind\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - InZeros - \"Wasted Mind\" - Like this video?

KrankTV.com!\n \n***\nAether Void - \"99.1% (Remastered)\" Official Teaser Video\nArtist city, country: Italy\n\nArtist Biography: Later the band’s goal was to release its first studio album, but some complications arose among the band members.\nAfter careful consideration singer Mirko Bagni reluctantly decided to leave the band, though remaining on good terms with the other members.\nThen, due to different artistic views, lead guitarist Domenico Rondinone and the rest of the band mutually decided to part ways.\nDespite the loss of two members, the band did not stop working on the album and the three remaining members carried on the project, yet deciding to make significant changes. New ideas and different influences led to a completely new approach in composition compared to the previous EP.\nThe project could go on thanks to two new members: Salvatore De Matteo (“Thore”) on vocals and Nicolò Bondioli (“Bond”) on lead guitar. With the new singer joining the band, the rough vocals which marked “Dirty Games” and “99.1%” were replaced by cleaner and more harmonic vocal lines that create a clear contrast with the previous songs.\nBecause of the huge changes affecting the band, in November 2017 the moniker was changed into “Aether Void”.\n“Aether Void” is currently recording its first full length at Art Distillery Studios in Modena. The album will be produced by Claudio Mulas (Logical Terror) and will be released in 2018.\n\nProducer Name: Art Distillery Studios\n\nAbout the Video:  This single is a homage to the famous tv series “Breaking Bad” . This song is a remastered version, originally played by No Way Out. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/OfficialAetherVoid/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialaethervoid/?hl=it\n\nSong Lyrics:\nI love my family, as well as chemistry\nThe city is at my feet, I rule the streets\nA cancer brought me here, erased my fear\nDown in my lab I cook\nmy pure blue sky\nI'm Heisenberg\nyou're goddamn right!\nNow say my name, bitch,\nhere I am the boss\nDo you know who you're talking to?\nI am the one who knocks\nEveryone's after me, in the DEA\nto rage I ain't no stranger, I am the danger\nMy back’s against the wall\nBetter call Saul\nDown in my lab I cook\nand here I hide\nI’m Heisenberg\nor Walter White?\nNow say my name, bitch,\nhere I am the boss\nDo you know who you're talking to?\nI am the one who knocks\nNow say my name, bitch,\nhere I am the boss\nDo you know who you're talking to?\nI am the one who knocks\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sPOnCDWGmnE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sPOnCDWGmnE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sPOnCDWGmnE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sPOnCDWGmnE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sPOnCDWGmnE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":449,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sPOnCDWGmnE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/PqiarsVbi7EeeJYgWGKOyLDl-z0\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnY2YWpsOXBBVzc0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-07T04:21:36.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Living Louder - \"Raw Meat\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Living Louder - \"Raw Meat\" - Like this video?

While we were sleeping, they showed us all dreams can be sold. Our leaders have set the world on fire, so who can we follow to reconnect our immortal minds with bodies we've borrowed? So we burn another page of what we can't erase, bury every memory. And we carry on this way, because we don't have to read the letters we delete. We worship the structures we built to bind us by design. Do you ever wonder what's waiting on the other side? Our heroes have taken heads for eyes and blindly we follow, seduced by machines that suck the life from bodies we've borrowed. So we burn another page of what we can't erase and the fires light our way. We can carry on the same, because every teacher reads a broken history. Here we are, dancing in the flames. Can we turn another page to set the story straight? Don't let it end this way. We may never be the same, but every chapter bleeds a darker well of ink.\" \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mEUIZZAxhM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mEUIZZAxhM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mEUIZZAxhM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mEUIZZAxhM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mEUIZZAxhM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":452,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"3mEUIZZAxhM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/CLMMu6lH-pmNhvNHfTALY-gYsSw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmFCbDJkZnZmRDRr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-06T23:31:43.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Jah Weedy - \"Ain't That N*gga\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Jah Weedy - \"Ain't That N*gga\" - Like this video?

Watson of Mobile county Alabama to create something truly unique that encapsulates many of these genres. The result is an extreme metal band with emphasis on musicality, grooves and epic passages that sonically attack and satisfy all senses of metal enthusiast all around. With their first album 'Beyond Omega', released in the early summer of 2016, they have played many shows along the gulf coast in support of their debut album which has wildly been excepted and sold copies around the world. With plans of a follow up album due out in late summer to fall of 2017, Oracle will once again attempt to enhance their keen sense of rhythms and melodies, sonic assault of solos and drum  work and heavy growls and emotions of passionate vocals.  \n\nDirector Name: Jason Long\nProducer Name: Jason Long\n\nAbout the Video: A man struggling with his addiction to alcohol.\n\nArtist Website: https://www.oracleextrememetal.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/oraclemetalband\nTwitter:https://www.twitter.com/oraclemetal \nBandCamp: https://www.oracleextrememetal.bandcamp.com \n\nLabel Name: Rain without End Records \nLabel Website: https://www.naturmacht.com\n\nSong Lyrics:“The Liquid Answer”\n\nNo god before me.\nNo one can hold restraint.\nNow taste the pleasures poured straight from the chalice.\nConfront the opposition before the fall.\nBecome the desperation. Answer the call.\n\nA fire inside for which it sinks its teeth.\nThe burning in time will bring you to your knees.\n\nThe liquid answer\n\nBehold the power.\nEmbrace the legacy.\nBecome the puppet of the beckoning fruit.\nThe chariot is waiting. The endless ride.\nSobriety is waning. All gone in time.\n\nA fire inside for which it sinks its teeth.\nThe burning in time will bring you to your knees.\n\nThe liquid answer\nThe liquid answer\n\nBURN from the inside out\n\nIt’s time you give this up.\nIt’s time you walk away.\nYou are now one with me. \nMy pleasure bringing you down.\n\nBack again so soon?\nBegging please!\nOne more thing to do. \nGet on your knees.\n\nThe liquid answer\nThe liquid answer\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bdUOeQ2IaqU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bdUOeQ2IaqU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bdUOeQ2IaqU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bdUOeQ2IaqU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bdUOeQ2IaqU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":455,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"bdUOeQ2IaqU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/1RXco8Z06GwlTHk9MbC7YcZ8bPM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnJpV1I0UkJxSEt3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-04T03:38:38.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"New Design - \"Say You Want Me\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - New Design - \"Say You Want Me\" - Like this video?

The band’s growing list of influences come from a variety of genres, but the atmosphere and emotion of post-rock and emo-rock served as the common link that brought the members together.\n\nDrawing inspiration from bands such as American Football, Brand New, Moneen, Moving Mountains and Toe, New Design’s music features dynamic and atmospheric sonic landscapes accompanied by memorable vocal melodies. Flashes of this sound were first heard in their debut EP 'Burn Out the Sky' (2012) and further defined in the single “The Things We Can’t Forget” (2014), but the band’s first-ever full-length album 'Far from Home' (2015) most closely represents their emotive live sound; the one that has been captivating fans at their live shows for years.\n\nDirector Name: Adrien Yiptong\nProducer Name: Adrien Yiptong\n\nArtist Website: http://www.newdesignmusic.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/newdesignmusic \nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newdesignmusic \nBandCamp: https://newdesignmusic.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newdesignmusic \nSoundCloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/newdesignmusic \n\nSong Lyrics: \"Say You Want Me\"\n\nYeah it's nothing else \nIf not a shot in the dark \nI'm tearing at my throat \n'cause I forgot how to speak \n\nYou were something else \nSwept me off of my feet \nTook a turn for the worse \nWhen my knees became weak \n\nIf I'm yours, say you want me \n\nAnd now we're following the dark lit \nPaths of our hearts \nYou can say it's not my fault but \nWords don't heal scars \n\nTell me what I should do\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/riWR4RBqHKw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/riWR4RBqHKw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/riWR4RBqHKw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/riWR4RBqHKw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/riWR4RBqHKw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":456,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"riWR4RBqHKw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/MaGY552ycgHXTy2oDO8vXLRaSFU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkFwS0VOTUJYbzk0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-06T21:04:35.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Sewer Rats - \"Too Punk for You\" A PunkNews / BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Sewer Rats - \"Too Punk for You\" - Like this video?

Walking the line between Stray Cats-cool, early 90s Social D. and old-school pop punk, the band sounds like Mr. Ness and Mr. Setzer were hanging out with Hank Williams, listening to the Ramones and teaching him new skateboard tricks while drinkin’ beers on a hot summer night.\nTheir new album 'Heartbreaks & Milkshakes' (Rookie Records/Rude Runner Records) takes the band to the next level and sounds like a sugar-high vision of 90s oldschool pop-punk with witty tongue-in-cheek humor and a greasy yet stylish 50s vibe. Delivering 12 catchy and well-crafted pop-punk sing-a-longs about heartbreak, black-metal chicks and moving back in with your parents (again), The SEWER RATS spent 2017 on the road in Europe and Japan to promote their new record. Playing the acoustic stage at Punk Rock Holiday in Slovenia, supporting CJ Ramone in Germany and playing the famous club Moon Step in Tokyo definitley were some of the band’s highlights 2017.\nIn 2018 the band will be playing some of the major European Punk Festivals and also be hitting the road in the United States together with friends and East Coast punks Jukebox Romantics.\n\nDirector Name: Michael Winkler\n \nProducer Name: Michael Winkler\n \nAbout the Video: The video was directed by Michael Winkler of Iconographic and shot in Miami, Florida and Frauenberg, Germany. This is our second time working with Michael, who also did our \"I Don't Like You (When Your Girl's Around)\" video. He is such a passionate and cool guy and working together just felt really good and natural because he totally knew what we wanted. He knows where we're coming from and has the same type of 90's skateboard/punk rock background so the result just completely blew our minds. We had so much fun doing this video since getting into a band fight in a pool has always been on our wishlist. Also, the guy in the video is his dad and his name is Horsti. They both went to Florida to shoot and Horsti even got his first ink in the video. Horsti is so rad. We're stoked on Horsti!\n\nArtist Website: http://www.sewerrats.net\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/sewerrats\nInstagram:@thesewerrats\nMerch: http://sewerrats.bigcartel.com\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/the-sewer-rats\nhttp://kannentime.com/\n\nLabel Name: Rookie Records (EUROPE), Rude Runner Records (JAPAN)\nLabel Website: http://www.ruderunnerrecords.com  http://www.rookierecords.de\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Too Punk for You\"\n \nWHEN I SEE YOU AT THE LIBRARY\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOU WILL NEVER GO OUT WITH ME\nCOS I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \nWHEN I TRY TO TALK TO YOU\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOU JUST STARE AT MY TATTOOS\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \nOH I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOU KNOW IT'S TRUE\nPUNK, TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nOH I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOU KNOW IT'S TRUE\nTHAT I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \nWHEN I LISTEN TO N.W.A.\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nWHEN I GO AND SKATE ALL DAY\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \nWHEN I TALK ABOUT MINOR THREAT\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOUR LOVE IS SOMETHING I WILL NEVER GET\nCOS I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \nOH I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOU KNOW IT'S TRUE\nPUNK, TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nOH I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOU KNOW IT'S TRUE\nTHAT I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \nWHEN I TELL YOU ABOUT D.I.Y.\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nWHEN I TEXT YOU AND YOU DON'T REPLY\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \nOH I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOU KNOW IT'S TRUE\nPUNK, TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nOH I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\nYOU KNOW IT'S TRUE\nTHAT I'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \nNO MATTER WHAT I DO\nYOU KNOW THAT IT'S TRUE\nI'M TOO PUNK FOR YOU\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApKENMBXo94/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApKENMBXo94/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApKENMBXo94/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApKENMBXo94/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApKENMBXo94/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":457,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ApKENMBXo94"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/41LP7iVDXvHtxtOe2iTg10P78yM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnhVREdVMV9rX3Br","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-02T10:30:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Crocell - \"Once Called Slaves\" LongLife Records - A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Crocell - \"Once Called Slaves\" - Like this video?

Kline and guitarist Mike Riley’s previous bands came to an end. The duo ran into each other and decided to get together to write some music. They wanted to write songs with no barriers. Both men united, armed with one purpose: to make kickass rock music!\nWith its roots in the alternative grunge movement of the ‘90s and added elements of classic rock, hard rock, and metal, Burdens Within covers all the bases and has created its own unique sound. Rounding out the lineup is Craig Thomas on drums, Ryan Alan Battering on lead guitar, and Daniel R. Rivers on vocals.\n\nDirector Name: Ryan Troy Kingma\nProducer Name: Ryan Troy Kingma and Ryan J. Kline\n\nAbout the Video: The video for “Dead End Towns” paints a haunting picture of a man who has not had the luxury to pursue his dreams. However, he still retains a sense of hope, as his love of music shows, despite these harsh circumstances. The story pairs well with shots of Burdens Within playing in front of an abandoned factory, which conjures up a sense of urban decay.\nDelving further into the meaning of this powerful hard rock song, bassist Ryan J. Kline notes, “There are many ‘Dead End Towns’ across America with little hope beyond factories or fast food. This song/video is a tribute to those who aspire for something more.”\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BurdensWithin/\nContact: burdenswithin@gmail.com\n\nLabel Name: Pavement Entertainment\nLabel Website: https://www.pavementmusic.com/\n\nSong Lyrics: \n\nVerse:\nI woke up yesterday\nAnd realized everything\nIn this life that won't come true\nThe prison I have built\nSurrounded by your guilt\nAnd I know there's nothing left to do\n\nChorus:\nBut I'll stay right here, hanging on\nI don't belong, my hope is gone\nSo I'll stay in this dead end town\nSinking down into the ground\n\nVerse:\nIs there anything that I could do or say\nThat would make you realize\nI always feel so strange?\nI need a different change\nAnd i need to cut off all my ties\n\nChorus:\nBut I'll stay right here, hanging on\nI don't belong, my hope is gone\nSo I'll stay in this dead end town\nSinking down into the ground\n\nRepeat chorus 2x\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n\nThumbs Up, Comment and Subscribe!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWF1S9QoBO0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWF1S9QoBO0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWF1S9QoBO0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWF1S9QoBO0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWF1S9QoBO0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":469,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SWF1S9QoBO0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/-n1GbZ6Hk5rPQdfw59HIiR6dsts\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkNNWHRZZUg3RGlJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-01T03:00:04.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Hope Street - \"Back to the Grey\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Hope Street - \"Back to the Grey\" - Like this video?

Early tours in the Midwest with Stitched Up Heart and City of the Weak generated the momentum that sparked a number of US Headlining tours going as far west as California and as far east as Pennsylvania. 2016’s tour schedule consisted of ninety-two shows across twenty-one states, forty-six cities, 47,906 miles and sixty-five days worth of drive time. This tour history has earned the band performances with Avenged Sevenfold, Stone Sour, Skillet, Gemini Syndrome, Lita Ford, and many more as well as a reputation for being one of the hardest working regional rock bands in the United States.\n\nThis passion and work ethic continues into 2017 with the much anticipated release of the band’s fourth EP 'Perspective.' Tour dates coming soon.\n\nDirector Name: Jake Raines\nProducer Name: Jake Raines\n\nAbout the Video: This video was shot and produced in Sioux City, Iowa, in support of the release of the album 'Perspective' by Scarlet Canary.\n\nArtist Website: https://scarletcanaryband.com/home\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ScarletCanary/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScarletCanary1\nMySpace: who has one of these anymore?\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/scarletcanary\nBandCamp: https://scarletcanary.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/scarletcanaryband/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Antidote\"\n\nChecked out don’t care about the world around you (Its all about you)\nYou loved and lost it made you cruel\nJust too hard to be Face reality\nLost causes don’t need sympathy\nThis bitter pill I’ve swallowed rotten to the core\nThe violent thrill that follows is the only cure\nThe more I ache the more I take\nThe antidote is my escape\nFrom what you’ve done to me\nYour poison remedy\n\nMisused your envy proves that you’re no angel (its all about you)\nCan’t say what makes your pain so damn special\nJust too hard to be Face reality\nLost causes don’t need sympathy\nRemedy\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n\nThumbs Up, Comment and Subscribe!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oGcoSuZEPZY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oGcoSuZEPZY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oGcoSuZEPZY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oGcoSuZEPZY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oGcoSuZEPZY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":471,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oGcoSuZEPZY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/SJmufs4NBYLyWa6_PCkW9zE1EJs\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk1VTUFCR1Badnh3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-01T00:00:56.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Diatomea - \"Cobain\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Diatomea - \"Cobain\" - Like this video?

Aggressive metal riffing, combined with rock moments and psychedelic digressions, are the musical foundation for critical lyrics against the contradictions of current society and their consequences on people's inner self. After various EPs, for their 10th anniversary Diatomea have decided to release their first proper full length, both an important mile stone for the band and a starting point for new energetic live shows.\n\nDirector Name: Simone Visconti\nProducer Name: Visco Studio\n\nAbout the Video: \"Cobain\" is the first single from the homonym full length of Italian alternative metal band \"Diatomea\". The song is not only a tribute to Nirvana's charismatic frontman, but it's also a reflection about the tendency to exploit and misread musical artists, transforming their personality into an icon. In fact, as often happens with charming musicians, Kurt Cobain was misunderstood on two levels: both with the moralistic opinion from who didn't understand the disease behind his drug addiction and suicide, and with the cynical reduction of his emotive and human complexity to a mere product to be sold. So \"Cobain\" isn't simply an imperative dedication to such an inspirational musician, but it's also an invitation to abandon every preconception about art, respecting the author behind it.\n\nWebsite: http://www.diatomea.it\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/diatomeaband\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/diatomea\nInstagram: @diatomeaofficial\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Cobain\"\n\nCERCAMI SE VUOI\nIO NON CI SARÒ\nGUARDA DOVE VUOI\nIO NON CI SARÒ\nSALVAMI SE PUOI\nIO NON CI SARÒ\nPREGA PER ME E POI\nIO NON CI SARÒ\n\nCOME IL SOGNO DI TE\n\nUSAMI SE VUOI\nNON CI SARÒ\nVENDI I TUOI EROI\nNON CI SARÒ\nDIPINGIMI SE VUOI\nIO NON CI SARÒ\nSUONA QUI SE VUOI\nIO CI SARÒ\n\nCOME IL SOGNO DI TE\nCOBAIN\n\nHEY HEY WANNABE COBAIN\nHEY HEY WANNABE COBAIN\nHEY HEY WANNABE COBAIN\nHEY HEY WANNABE COBAIN\n\nCOME IL SOGNO DI TE\nCOBAIN\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n\nThumbs Up, Comment and Subscribe!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MUMABGPZvxw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MUMABGPZvxw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MUMABGPZvxw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MUMABGPZvxw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MUMABGPZvxw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":472,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"MUMABGPZvxw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/lFNKXrVq6skXn5DWjiHif5KEmHA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlRWYlkzZ1R5M3lV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-31T22:07:51.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Drug of Choice - \"Monsters Inside Us\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Drug of Choice - \"Monsters Inside Us\" - Like this video?

You will dance, laugh, and sing along at the top of your lungs even if you really can't sing, and all your friends know it and love you nevertheless. You will find yourself tapping your foot and nodding your head although you're “not really into reggae, I'm a metal guy”. You will be happier than you thought you could be. You will end up in places you didn't even know existed. And somehow you'll make it home safely with your keys, phone and wallet intact. Jaya the Cat will leave glitter confetti in your bedroom floor and take you out for breakfast. Or lunch, because, you know, breakfast will definitely be too early for you.\nOriginating in Boston 1998, Jaya the Cat promptly relocated to Amsterdam, and with a crew of diverse and international musicians continue perfecting the art of making the perfect musical cocktail to get you through this night and into the next one, with equal parts reggae, punk, ska, a splash of electronics and a sprig of dub with a shot of whiskey on the side. In between a relentless touring schedule through clubs and festivals across Europe and beyond, that is downright confusing they keep up considering what they get up to, they've recently recorded their fifth studio full length album set to be released in November 2017. “A Good Day For The Damned” continues the path the band has put itself on with their previous releases. Winding down city streets and across moonlit beaches, staggering past carnivals and drunken sunrises, come 15 new tales of heartbreak and happiness, political confusion (and who hell isn't confused nowadays with that orange haired maniac running things) existential madness but in the end, overall optimism. The right concoction to get Jaya the Cat, and you, in the right mood for what the night holds for you. \n\nDirector Name:  Gaynelle Szoboszlai\nProducer Name: Steven Brautigam\n\nArtist Website: http://www.jayathecat-band.com/\nFacebook: https://en-gb.facebook.com/JayaTheCat/\nBandCamp: https://jayathecat.bandcamp.com/\n\nLabel Name: Bomber Music Ltd.\nLabel Website: http://www.bombermusic.com/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Amsterdam\"\n\nNow there's this girl I know She lives down by the sea I know I'm not the only one But sometimes she makes some time for me And all the fools line up and she takes their money But she breaks her promises and goes on home alone She's overrated I know, Look how early the bars close And weed, you can pretty much get that anywhere But on a night like tonight Staggering under the street lights, I remember I'm your man And as the morning breaks We add up our mistakes I know this light's not kind to us But you still look fucking fabulous This shrapnel in my pocket this conversation with my conscience Oh My God what have you done She's overrated I know,Look how early the bars close And weed, you can pretty much get that anywhere But on a night like tonight, Staggering under the street lights, Don't forget that I'm your man Amsterdam.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n\nThumbs Up, Comment and Subscribe!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNXPCUYvTjM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNXPCUYvTjM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNXPCUYvTjM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNXPCUYvTjM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNXPCUYvTjM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":476,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"uNXPCUYvTjM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Dd-0SppjULrAhAQwdGzsS6e0nFU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlJjMWN1S0oxd0tF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-30T05:23:54.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Next Year - \"Fall Apart\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Next Year - \"Fall Apart\" - Like this video?

Taking their name from a combination of literary references and Spanish that when combined roughly translates to 'silver tongued devils,' Galanos music is darkly seductive and coldly aloof at the same time. Their debut 7\" is steeped in the solo sounds of Stiv Bators and early Lords of the New Church, the cinematic expanses of Ennio Morricone, and relentless fuzz drone of surf guitars. Their debut 7\" provides two contrasting songs that only scratch the surface of this complex band. A sound that Fred Mills of Blurt Magazine calls \"rich in atmosphere and unnerving in its tragic grace\" and added \"there is much here that bodes well for an intriguing future.\"\n\nDirector Name: Gregory D Jaw\nProducer Name: John Steinheimer\n\nArtist Website: https://pyrrhicvictoryrecordings.com/galanos\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/galanos13/\nTwitter: @galanoslaloca / https://twitter.com/galanoslaloca\nBandCamp: https://galanos.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wearegalanos\nDiscogs: https://www.discogs.com/artist/3193938-Galanos\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/galanos-1\n\nLabel Name: Pyrrhic Victory Recordings\nLabel Website: https://pyrrhicvictoryrecordings.com\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n\nThumbs Up, Comment and Subscribe!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wIH0zGCmvTw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wIH0zGCmvTw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wIH0zGCmvTw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wIH0zGCmvTw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wIH0zGCmvTw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":484,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"wIH0zGCmvTw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/m6IBQaJkUKEr0SSBmBazRkYy3Us\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjlDSFFxakVQMFVN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-27T23:24:26.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Wewain - \"Venceremos\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Wewain - \"Venceremos\" - Like this video?

In March of 2015 bassist-vocalist Mistina La Fave suffered a brain hemorrhage the night before the band was scheduled to enter the studio. The recovery was physically and mentally taxing, and La Fave is lucky to be alive, let alone playing and performing again. The Prids’ 22 years have been marked with death, sickness, divorce, and a near-fatal van crash that cut a tour short and left members bloody and broken—but they survive through the friendship and bond of founding members La Fave and guitarist-vocalist David Frederickson. While those events have invariably made their way into the band’s narrative, the two simply chalk it up to life.\nThey met in La Fave’s small hometown of Saint Joseph, Missouri, in 1995, not long after Frederickson had moved there from Southern California. They started a relationship (they divorced in 2001, not long after they married), formed The Prids, and moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, before settling in Portland, Oregon, in 1999. In that time they’ve released four full-lengths and a trail of EPs, toured all over the world, while gaining the respect of bands throughout Portland for their tenacity and longevity (The Prids are one of the longest-running active bands in the city). They continue to make music for the right reasons—with or without a label, for themselves. A few years ago they brought in drummer Gordon Nickel and multi-instrumentalist Tim Yates, their sturdiest lineup to date. These four individuals are what make 'Do I Look Like I’m in Love?' such a special record.\nThroughout it all The Prids have remained completely DIY (the band even launched its own label/artist collective This-a-Way Records in 1996). Their videos and album art are as brilliantly conceived as the music itself. And in 2017 the Prids are playing with the same ardor they did 20 years ago. They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and this band is the embodiment of that.\n\nDirector Name: Gordon Nickel \n\nAbout the Video: An American fever dream... surrounded by artificial people and disposable culture, what will the rational people be devout about? \n\nArtist Website: http://www.theprids.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theprids/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/theprids?lang=en\nBandCamp: https://www.theprids.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_prids/?hl=en\n\nLabel Name: This-a-Way Records\nLabel Website: http://www.thisawayrecords.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Summer Cult\"\n\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YVNPkBARH5k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YVNPkBARH5k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YVNPkBARH5k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YVNPkBARH5k/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YVNPkBARH5k/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":489,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YVNPkBARH5k"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/AQC0jBOpi7BFyJ1FHMdfJ4nXzoY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnU1VUNDb2FLcGpv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-26T23:29:57.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Dementia - \"Too Long\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Dementia - \"Too Long\" - Like this video?

In March of 2015 bassist-vocalist Mistina La Fave suffered a brain hemorrhage the night before the band was scheduled to enter the studio. The recovery was physically and mentally taxing, and La Fave is lucky to be alive, let alone playing and performing again. The Prids’ 22 years have been marked with death, sickness, divorce, and a near-fatal van crash that cut a tour short and left members bloody and broken—but they survive through the friendship and bond of founding members La Fave and guitarist-vocalist David Frederickson. While those events have invariably made their way into the band’s narrative, the two simply chalk it up to life.\nThey met in La Fave’s small hometown of Saint Joseph, Missouri, in 1995, not long after Frederickson had moved there from Southern California. They started a relationship (they divorced in 2001, not long after they married), formed The Prids, and moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, before settling in Portland, Oregon, in 1999. In that time they’ve released four full-lengths and a trail of EPs, toured all over the world, while gaining the respect of bands throughout Portland for their tenacity and longevity (The Prids are one of the longest-running active bands in the city). They continue to make music for the right reasons—with or without a label, for themselves. A few years ago they brought in drummer Gordon Nickel and multi-instrumentalist Tim Yates, their sturdiest lineup to date. These four individuals are what make 'Do I Look Like I’m in Love?' such a special record.\nThroughout it all The Prids have remained completely DIY (the band even launched its own label/artist collective This-a-Way Records in 1996). Their videos and album art are as brilliantly conceived as the music itself. And in 2017 the Prids are playing with the same ardor they did 20 years ago. They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and this band is the embodiment of that.\n\nDirector Name: Tim Yates \n\nAbout the Video: From a cancelled 8-bit platform game, The Prids must be freed from their evil sadness, which has turned them into monstrous bosses of a surreal land. Your protagonist is randomly generated during the opening menu sequence: a nameless and gender-neutral every-person (they wear a shirt featuring the non-binary flag for most of the video). Your choices for how to defeat the various baddies are always non-violent, from simply sprinting to offering up vegan tacos. Some of the enemies also behave in ways inspired by the struggles of LGBTQ people; one-eyed pyramid creatures representing harmful religious doctrine, and knights of solid stone with scrolls symbolizing unjust and rigid legislation, for example. Watch it a few times to see if you can catch all the Easter eggs\n\nArtist Website: http://www.theprids.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theprids/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/theprids?lang=en\nBandCamp: https://www.theprids.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_prids/?hl=en\n\nLabel Name: This-a-Way Records\nLabel Website: http://www.thisawayrecords.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Mangled\"\n\nMangled hearts created by a tongue that didn't mean it\nNotes swell from hands misleading\nTime jerks and crashes you into \nThe place to go\nWhere no one knows \nIt's you who's killing me\n\nSmart girls getting faded\nBroken vow and England's shaken\nSugarpills might fuel this lifeline \nBut that dulled ache still takes you to the place I'll be\nWhere no one sees it's you who rests in me \n\nMangled hearts can't break \nThe damage done, saves\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mqOfUCU2c1k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mqOfUCU2c1k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mqOfUCU2c1k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mqOfUCU2c1k/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mqOfUCU2c1k/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":498,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"mqOfUCU2c1k"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/OFDEn59ws4JEaGdKHsI85xZLJJw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmtVVUt6Xzh2eVZR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-24T22:04:08.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Popey - \"5 O'Clock\" The A&R Department - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Popey - \"5 O'Clock\" - Like this video?

With Memorial he released a self-titled demo in 2008 and played regularly in local clubs in the Amsterdam area. After Memorial broke up in 2010, Rens H. worked as a roadie, merchandise seller and stand-in guitar player for Last Fear, another respected Dutch underground metal act form The Netherlands. In the meantime, Rens H. never lost the passion for writing music and is always determined to expand his musical capabilities. This is the exact reason why Rens H. decided to record some of his own songs in early 2015.\nIn a search for additional musicians, Rens H. met Dutch metal drummer Melle Kramer (ex. Obsidian, Industrial Passage and present Dauthuz). He is well-known for his technical and aggressive style of playing and is inspired by bands such as Cynic, Devin Townsend, Messhuggah, Gordian Knot and Death. It was not long before Rens realized that Melle was the ideal drummer to bring his vision to life. After ideas were exchanged, both musicians became excited about a possible collaboration and after a jam session they decided to join forces in what now is known as Degenerate.\n\nDirector Name: Rens H.\nProducer Name: Rens H.\n\nAbout the Video: As to give anyone who love’s hard music a taste of what 2018 bring; Shows, songs and even something bigger!

I Love You is taken from the coming third album ”Leave It All Behind”, to be launched in June 2018. The line-up for this album is completely new aside the founder Marcus Hanser. The new line-up includes the exceptional female singer Petra Kvännå, she will sing your socks off before you know what happened. \n\nDirector Name: Amrit Daniel Forss\nProducer Name: Marcus Hanser\n\nAbout the Video: The song was originally a soundtrack in several TV-commercials for Save the Children, Sweden. This was over ten years ago but the campaign is still controversial  and engages many, so we decided to revisit the song and invite one of Sweden’s most known metal singers, Jakob Samuel from The Poodles. The video portraits the pain of many ongoing conflict areas of the world and put it in the child/parent perspective. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.nerved.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/nervedband\nTwitter: @nervedband\nInstagram: @nervedband\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzIkQVDWVtD2WeHE0aAITxw\n\nLabel Name: MMS Records\nLabel Website:\n\nSong Lyrics: \"I Love You\"\n\nI Love You\nSending out an S.O.S. \nTo you, my love \nSending out an S.O.S.\nIt’s true, my love \nSending out an S.O.S.\nTo you, my love \nWe can make it anywhere \nWe can find another way \nTo heal, to live \nTo feel, it’s real \nFor me, for you \nYou know, it’s true \n \nI Love You \n \nCan you hear my S.O.S.\nTo you, my love \nCan you feel the S.O.S.\nSo true, my love \nWe can make it anywhere \nWe can make it all so well \nAnd heal, to live \nAnd feel, it’s real \nFor me, for you \nYou know, it’s true \n \nI Love You \nSending out an S.O.S. now \n(guitar solo) \nI Love You \nSending out an S.O.S. now\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/76MxYJsbArA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/76MxYJsbArA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/76MxYJsbArA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/76MxYJsbArA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/76MxYJsbArA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":502,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"76MxYJsbArA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/VI29ZLh-ktOfGv45_o_xXh5xP1w\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm9pc2VhVlJiWkFj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-24T00:08:52.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Steal Reserve - \"Letters Home\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Steal Reserve - \"Letters Home\" - Like this video?

Formed in 2016 by Mike Carroll & Dave Bourke who had been writing and recording an album to bring to possible members. The album became the debut XERO album.\n\nCarroll and Bourke decided every track should come from differing influeces which would range from soft rock to hardcore and thrash metal and everything in between.\nThey felt the worst thing that could happen was to be placed into a certain category which the band would then have to adhere to stylistically. The album has a large variety of sounds and pulls influences from bands ranging from Pantera to Faith No More, Metallica to HIM, Black Sabbath to Oasis.\n\nCarroll and Bourke found comon musical ground with drummer Andrew Farell, bassist Nick Bromfield, keyboard player Peter Meehan and lead guitarist Conny O’Connor and began jamming the songs which gave them quite a long set from the beginning putting them ahead of a lot of other bands in the local scene who were just releasing EP’s at the time.\nOver the last two years the band has worked hard refining their sound and tightness with one another and has written and recorded their first release featuring the writing influences of all band members, ‘SPITE’. SPITE is a 3 track EP showcasing a more evolved sound. During the writing and recording of the EP the band crossed paths with metal giant Jeff Waters of the legendary Canadian thrash band Annihilator who collaborated on the release bringing his writing style and lead guitar skills to the table further driving the sound into much more professional sounding territory.\n\nEvery song on the band’s new batch of material is inspired by the mood and atmosphere of different horror movies of the 1960’s. Every song is different to the last but they all share a comon dark and aggressive edge which unifies the tracks.\n\nSPITE will be released in March 2018.\n\nDirector Name: Ken Coleman\nProducer Name: Ken Coleman\n\nAbout the Video: The video was shot in Limerick city in the band's practice space for a full day by Ken Coleman who has done album art for bands such as Morbid Angel. The video places the most importance on the band and is shot like a play through with digitally rendered models flashing in and out of focus.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/XEROLimerick/\nTwitter: @XLimerick\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/xero_limerick/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.ie/pin/357684395397233184/?lp=true\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Reality\"\n\nBlack and light, we're alive,\nMellow in the shadow,\nDay and night, pain of life,\nIn  a fight against the flow,\nGuide me through the blur of time,\n \nSometimes it's hard to breathe,\nWhile waiting for a casualty,\nIs this the way it was meant to be,\nSometimes it's hard to believe,\nWe're living in reality,\nDream of the day where we can be free,\n \nHolding on to what is gone,\nWaiting in the hollow,\nTrying to go on,\nScared of what's to follow,\nIf only you could see through the eyes I see,\n \nSometimes it's hard to breathe,\nWhile waiting for a casualty,\nIs this the way it was meant to be,\nSometimes it's hard to believe,\nWe're living in reality,\nDream of the day where we can be free, (Dream of the day)\n \nAll I want is to survive,\nGuide me through the blur of time,\nStep into the great divide,\nGetting lost within the tides,\n \nSometimes it's hard to breathe,\nWhile waiting for a casualty,\nIs this the way it was meant to be,\nSometimes it's hard to believe,\nWe're living in reality,\nDream of the day where we can be free, (Dream of the day)\n \nSometimes it's hard to believe,\nWhile waiting for a casualty,\nIs this the way it was meant to be,\nSometimes it's hard to believe,\nWe're living in reality,\nDream of the day where we can be free\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WGqRle66sRo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WGqRle66sRo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WGqRle66sRo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WGqRle66sRo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WGqRle66sRo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":509,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"WGqRle66sRo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ZBdqRT8ruWMB2JWC6NIP47lnqic\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlBSTnpWbmhVWVo0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-19T22:40:27.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Taylor Colson - \"Blame It on My Body\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.TranqTV.com - Taylor Colson - \"Blame It on My Body\" - Like this video?

Upon murdering Balder, the fairest wisest of Gods; Loki was severely punished by Skald. Bound to three stones in an underground cave, Loki sat fastened by the intestines of his very own slain son whilst a cobra dripped burning venom onto his face. Luckily for Loki, his faithful wife Sigyn, remained by his side with a bowl to catch the drops of falling poison.\nHowever, once in a while, Sigyn had leave his side to empty the venom. While she was away, the dripping poison seared his face causing him to writhe in pain. Shaking violently, Loki brought about earthquakes in Midgard, the world of humanity. This remained the lot of Loki and Sigyn until, as destined, Loki broke free from his chains at Ragnarok and aided the giants in destroying the cosmos.\n \nArtist Website: http://www.lastlegionband.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/lastlegionband\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/lastlegionband\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/lastlegionband\nBandCamp: https://lastlegionband.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/lastlegionband\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/lastlegionband\n\nLabel Name: Gravel Entertainment\nLabel Website: http://www.gravelentertainment.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"God ov Chaos\"\n\nFallen earth, fallen sky\nBleeding, bleeding suffering\nWhen I try again to break free\nMy writhing shakes the world\nCurse the earth, Curse the sky\nCurse the gods on the halls on high\nCurse the middle earth, Burn it down\n\nSoon I will be free\nThen all shall know the \nGod of chaos\n\nFrozen earth, frozen sky\nThree long winters passed me by\nPlotting, planning, suffering\nI simply writhe to shake the world\nBroken earth, broken sky\nBreak bifrost the bridge of light\nBreak the middle earth, smash it all\n\nI've the blood of \nThe burning fire\nAlone I'll stand\nGod of chaos\n\nI've the blood of giants\nIn me there is the burning fire\nI will cut down the tree of life\nI will cast down the cowards of asgard\nAlone shall I stand\nThe king of the world\nThe master of fate\nThe god of chaos\n\nI've the blood of giants \nI cast down the cowards\nAlone shall I stand \n\nAlone shall I stand\nKing of the world\nMaster of fate\nGod of chaos\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mBQqIw_732s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mBQqIw_732s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mBQqIw_732s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mBQqIw_732s/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mBQqIw_732s/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":511,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"mBQqIw_732s"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/GcorJ2f5HHyXkvJkcSAMDG3RRRg\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Li1FNnplVDM4R0pZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-19T19:42:47.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Robert Jakob - \"Life Is Free\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Robert Jakob - \"Life Is Free\" - Like this video?

A time machine? Unlikely. A midlife crisis? Perhaps.\nEither way, Colonel Sun is the brainchild of Montreal-native Scott Cook (formerly Dead Days, Ablyss, Bodyjarr). On the edge of abandonment, Scott realized that he had a few more stories to tell. So, armed with his guitar, his voice, and his laptop, he took a journey through a mind full of memories, anecdotes, and sarcasm. To Scott's surprise, this journey culminated in an invasion of sorts—a suburban invasion, in fact—and, in the blink of an eye, a musical battle plan had been laid. Proudly, Scott promoted himself to Colonel. However, he quickly realized that an invasion of this scale could not be fought alone. Enter longtime comrades Mishka Stein and Robbie Kuster (of Patrick Watson) as well as Simon Angell (of Thus Owls). Without hesitation, this fearless trio assumed their stations and the four brave soldiers entered the battlefield...\nNow, Montreal-based Colonel Sun is a rock n' roll band, inspired by music that is charged by feel and emotion. Compared to bands such as Mudhoney, Failure, and Helmet, Colonel Sun clearly runs on fuel from the '90s. However, the members' collective musical background is so eclectic that the band's dirty-rock edge is, at times, polished by musically-progressive overtones. \n \nSince the release of Colonel Sun's debut EP, 'Suburban Invasion' (released April 2017), the band has been receiving positive attention that has included airplay (CHOM 97.7, CJLO, CKUT) and interviews (Bucketlist Music Reviews), and has performed at local venues including Turbo Haus, Barfly, La Vitrola, and Bar Le Ritz. The band just opened up for New York hardcore legend Harley Flanagan (CroMags) at Coop Katacombs, and will perform at Pouzza Fest 2018. So keep an ear out, 'cause this battle has only just begun!!\n\nDirector Name: Scott Cook\nProducer Name: Scott Cook\n\nAbout the Video: Teaser for Colonel Sun's debut EP, 'Suburban Invasion', available for streaming on Apple Music and Spotify, and for purchase on Bandcamp.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/colonelsunband\nBandCamp: http://colonelsun.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: @colonelsunband\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lDsnM9oH_aI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lDsnM9oH_aI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lDsnM9oH_aI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lDsnM9oH_aI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lDsnM9oH_aI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":513,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lDsnM9oH_aI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/zGQjtu5POpx7r56-q9hk4b-ujXw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnBmaF9QNHVUS1Q0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-19T14:00:08.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Shell Corporation - \"Make It Rain\" La Escalera Records / Gunner Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Shell Corporation - \"Make It Rain\" - Like this video?

Delivering a jet black prognosis of twenty something life through a blend of raw energy, hip-hop influenced grooves and the syncopated grind of 8 bit guitar. The band have spent the last year working in the studio with award winning producer Tom Donovan, finding ways to push the boundaries of what is considered ‘Rock music’. Drawing influences from Rock, Indie and hip-hop, The Baskervilles are for people who enjoy the likes of the Arctic Monkeys, Biffy Clyro, The Libertines, The Amazons, Royal Blood, Two Door Cinema Club and Catfish and the Bottlemen.\n\nDirector Name: Self-Directed \nProducer Name: Self-Produced\n\nAbout the Video: Blending raw energy, hip-hop influenced grooves and the syncopated grind of 8 bit guitar, Royal Blood, Biffy Clyro and Arctic Monkeys’ influenced rock quartet The Baskervilles return with ‘Kalashnikov’ music video. The ‘Kalashnikov’ video follows frontman James Betts switching between the AK-47 and his guitar, burying and burning the rifle in true rock and roll fashion. \n\nHaving released ‘Kalashnikov’ 1st December 2017, the band wanted to bring the track to life with the self-produced video reflecting the messages within the  lyrics. \n\nThe Baskervilles explain: \"Kalashnikov is the voice of anger for anyone who has the sense that we are currently being dealt a bleak future through the decisions made by the elite few. Though don't mistake Kalashnikov as a war cry for violence, the message in both the song and video is about taking a hard look into the twisted mirror of our society and understanding it's full of hypocrisy, the world needs to change but nothing good can come from screaming peace and love with a Kalashnikov in your hands.”\n\nThe band have spent the last year working in the studio with award winning producer Tom Donovan, finding ways to push the boundaries of what is considered ‘rock music’.\n\nArtist Website: https://www.thebaskervillesofficial.com/epk \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thebaskervillesmusic/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BaskervillesUK \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the_baskervilles/ \n\nLabel Name: Regent Street Records\nLabel Website: http://regentstreetrecords.com \n\nSong Lyrics: \"Kalashnikov\"\n\nI’ll hold your hand and tell you all the things you wanna hear Like how it’s fine don’t mind the ones who say the end is near They’re out their fucking minds tryna hold me down They’re running out of time they better do it now Cuz’ I’m thinking we Are cut out to be An Iconic pair of public enemies You could be Fidel and I’ll be Che Guevara We could make a better tomorrow If we scribble a plan on an old coke can Revolution isn’t all that hard Screaming peace and love with a Kalashnikov Pointed at the ones in charge So kiss me twice and tell me all the things I wanna know Like how you’re mine and how you’ll never ever let me go I go out my mind when you’re not around Don’t wanna sit on the thrown I wanna burn it down Cuz’ I’m thinking we Don’t really need Laser guided ballistic democracy We’re running out of time tryna hold it down I wanna revolution and I want it now We could scribble a plan on an old coke can Revolution isn’t all that hard Screaming peace and love with a Kalashnikov Pointed at the ones in charge Screaming peace and love With a Kalashnikov We could scribble a plan on an old coke can Revolution isn’t all that hard Screaming peace and love with a Kalashnikov Pointed at the ones you love\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oySzZ7a4zTM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oySzZ7a4zTM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oySzZ7a4zTM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oySzZ7a4zTM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oySzZ7a4zTM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":521,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oySzZ7a4zTM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/0JMLO6DeL1AaqGLjXVWw6At57bA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Li11bW8xTlVRallz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-18T17:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Phoxjaw - \"Lottery\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Phoxjaw - \"Lottery\" - Like this video?

Their sound is most reminiscent to the likes of At the Drive-In and Deftones, their added melodic tenacity and driving riffs mixed with their ferocious energy on stage, making them a true force to be reckoned with.\nPhoxjaw's heavily distorted sounds coupled with their intense lyrics and emotive vocals have seen them championed by the likes of Kerrang Radio's Alex Baker who praises their 'cataclysmic riffs', as well as Scuzz's Alex Herron who labelled them one of the best new bands he's heard.\n\nDirector Name: James Harris\nProducer Name: James Harris\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/phoxjawofficial/\nBandCamp: https://phoxjaw.bandcamp.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/phoxjaw\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/phoxjaw/\n\nLabel Name: Indecent Records\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-umo1NUQjYs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-umo1NUQjYs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-umo1NUQjYs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-umo1NUQjYs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-umo1NUQjYs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":522,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-umo1NUQjYs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/zNv6_fiwOWN8_OF-yEVGTkkVS10\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkhXcDhIZV93cXJ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-18T15:00:04.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Birthday Boy - \"Through the Sound\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Birthday Boy - \"Through the Sound\" - Like this video?

The following members to join were Tomi (singer in Anomaly) and Paul (bass player in Break-out). Not long after Bobbo (ex Skullp) was aproached and a first rehearsal was schedueled. We feel that each and everyone of us sees life, the moments of his existence in a different way. The way we approach the matter is what makes us unique, therefore we are all divided by perception. The goal of the group is to honor music, to create that which every individual needs to hear, to be by the side of the listener in every aspect of life, sad or happy. We will do our best to honor it. \nSo far we played with Veil Of Maya, Betraying The Martyrs, To Kill Achilles, Cedron, Close Your Eyes, Every Man Is An Island, at the Peninsula/Felsziget in 2013 and Wacken Metal Battle Romania Finals in 2017.\n\nDirector Name: Sebastian Vacariuc\nProducer Name: Chamaeleo - Capturing Light\n\nAbout the Video: Actress name from the video: Andrada Has\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DividedByPerception/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dbpband\nBandCamp: https://dividedbyperception.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dividedbyperception/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Affliction\"\n\nYou can't break free You can't tear us apart We will fight our way back home You can't hear me You can't tear us apart You shall witness From lies we depart Take one step Take one breath Cause this is real And everything you fear I see the masses They're dying inside Searching for answers Their rights are denied They strive to glimpse The light one last time Our species will form A new paradigm I see the sickness I feel their pain We are as one, we form a chain To bring them down For what they did Together we'll form a new grid Silence A moment of peace Filled with anger It kills like a disease Stray from the path If you want to be free So sick of the sound Of your fucking belief I can see the world Burning through your eyes x2 No More Affliction\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoeJHroSVzE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoeJHroSVzE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoeJHroSVzE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoeJHroSVzE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoeJHroSVzE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":524,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"uoeJHroSVzE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/4D7BRjEnDAFjEmH1WCUoJf-ChIE\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmhOSDB6dEdmeFI0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-18T13:00:07.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Palatine Harbor - \"Ten Million Cries\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Palatine Harbor - \"Ten Million Cries\" - Like this video?

Jeremy was always a fan of music, but it wasn’t until his later high school years that he discovered his knack for it. Driven by his passion, he taught himself to play the guitar and began to write and perform music.\n\nOver the past decade, Jeremy has played all over the U.S. and in Europe, including numerous venues in Texas. Pulling from the example of Texas performance artists, Jeremy loves to interact with his audience. He captivates the crowd with his genuine personality, unique humor, and heart-felt love of his occupation.\n\nJeremy draws from his personal experiences to create songs that are keenly perceptive and meaningful. His current single, “Burn This House Down,” paints a poignant picture of heartbreak and acceptance that still remains relatable.

The core philosophy that drives DESPYRE is the combination of two emotions that forms the basis of their name, despair and inspire. The band’s mission is to encourage those who have reached a point where life has lost its spark through driving, melodic, and hard-hitting music. They strive to re-ignite that fire… Or, as they define DESPYRE, “To have once given up all hope, which in turn motivates or compels the passion to do something profound, prolific, and exceptional.”\n \nThe band has worked to create their own unique, contemporary sound with crunching guitar riffs, pounding bass and drums, and melodic vocal melodies, delivered with a balance heart-stopping screams and notable choral styling. Irritation breathes new life into the alt-metal genre.\n\nDirector Name: Kevin J. Cassidy\nProducer Name: Despyre Music\n\nAbout The Video: DESPYRE releases the official lyric video for \"Blue Sky.\" The heavy-hitting, powerful single comes from their debut EP, Irritation (2017), available everywhere digitally via Pavement Entertainment.\n\n\"A soul is never truly lost,\" says vocalist Rob on \"Blue Sky.\" The song was written to help people coping with the loss of loved ones who have committed suicide. \"Celebrate the life. Don't ask why. Look ahead to tomorrow.\" The group also wishes to offer support to those who battle with depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nArtist Website: https://www.despyre.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/despyre\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/despyreinfo\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/despyre\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/despyremusic/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2YALtzJrED-VOilfcZWUXg\n\nLabel Name: Pavement Entertainment\nLabel Website: https://www.pavementmusic.com/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Blue Sky\"\n\nScream\nI love and miss the sound of your voice\nDream\nWhen I’m feeling you by my side\nRage\nAngered by the answers to why\nPain\nI keep it bottled up deep inside\nHope you’re at peace now\nSuffering complete\nScream and shout\nCan’t find my way out\nTears are not enough\nI reach out my hand\nDrowning despair\nClose my eyes and fly\nBeen searching for blue skies\nSunrises and sunset\nIn the dark I hear your cries\nYour soul it lays at rest\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6IFZQ5pWbkY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6IFZQ5pWbkY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6IFZQ5pWbkY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6IFZQ5pWbkY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6IFZQ5pWbkY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":531,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6IFZQ5pWbkY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/oX3bLG-tzWYZh611Y4Xmht5sX9U\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm1nTHM3Zzh2Y2lF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-15T23:25:16.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Wilderman - \"Cog\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.TranqTV.com - Wilderman - \"Cog\" - Like this video?

Marfa is about as far as one can get -- both metaphorically and literally -- from coastal tech capitals, a place where a strong wind can knock the whole town offline for hours. \nBut it’s more complicated than that, as a conversation with Gungor about the album’s recording revealed one sunny July afternoon. A deeper listen to 'Artifice', this new collection of yearning, polyrhythmic pop music, reveals the influence of other unexpected intersections: the digital African psychedelia explored by David Byrne, Talking Heads, and Brian Eno, the cut-and-pasted township anthems of Paul Simon’s Graceland, and the quiet resonance of Donald Judd’s permanently installed works.\nThe list of players on the record includes members of the burgeoning Marfa community (Andy Stack of Wye Oak) old friend John Arndt (The Brilliance), Gungor’s Grammy-nominated brother Michael, McKenzie Smith (Midlake), Jeremy Harris, and Andrew McGuire. Hugo Nicholson (Radiohead, Father John Misty, Primal Scream) sat in as engineer. \nGungor’s first Wilderman album, 2013’s 'Learn to Feel', was recorded in an entirely analog setting; this collection is the opposite. As Gungor says, “That last record was me being like ‘fuck digital technology. Let’s keep things analog. There’s something between ones and zeroes that gets lost from our human spark.’” \nBut spending time with the work of Judd and James Turrell -- two artists with deeply personal work that does not bear the mark of the artist’s hand -- changed his outlook. “While it’s amazing to see the Mona Lisa and know that Da Vinci’s hands touched that, there’s something equally transcendent in Turrell’s works. Something about that that made me say okay: Art is a medium and an affectation. It doesn’t have to be me coming directly through it to be connected.” \n\nDirector Name: Robert Gungor\n\nAbout the Video: The \"Cog\" video uses footage from from “Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation” - an experiment by NVIDIA that uses adversarial networks to create imaginary celebrity pictures “dreamed up by a random number generator”. \nAs culture homogenizes on the internet and globalization becomes prevalent, people lose a sense of cultural identity and individuality. What we are “fed” is filtered through algorithm, influences our decisions and ultimately, identity - not dissimilar to these artificial celebrities we see on the screen. \nNot only that, but the continual morphing of the endless faces gives the illusion of a singular crowd-identity, making it difficult to discern their individual uniqueness.\n\nArtist Website: http://wilderman.us \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/wildermanmusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/wildermanmusic\nBandCamp: https://wilderman.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/wldrmn\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Cog\"\n\nEveryone moving in mechanical rhythm \nNot one or two or eight \nbillion isolated movements \n\nBut as a singular power source\nFrom a uniform transmission\nNo one moving for one but, for all\n\nMove it right\nmove in line of action\neverybody's movin in a line\n\nNearly all the time \nyou're spending on the path \nIs boring you\n\nStop adding friction to the line \nby slacking off in motion\n\nYou just gotta keep on moving on\n\nMove it right\nmove in line of action\nor break off\nand don't interfere\n\nMove it right\nmove in line of action\neverybody's movin in a line\n\nI can see the day when we’re all moving as one\nIt’s the silent death of the individual\nAll the edges smooth, all human flaw is gone\nI say fuck that, you gotta do your thing\n\nI won’t go on moving and moving,\nI won’t go on moving in line\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mgLs7g8vciE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mgLs7g8vciE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mgLs7g8vciE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mgLs7g8vciE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mgLs7g8vciE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":532,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"mgLs7g8vciE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/xgmWX2e63Q2fLYOsrtx1foCUFZo\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk5tT1RudVVOTDFj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-15T23:09:31.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Rahn Anthoni - \"Highway\" MTS Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.HankTV.com - Rahn Anthoni - \"Highway\" - Like this video?

Feels like I'm losing out if I sleep at night. Keg stand, back pain, party game, in between- whoa! Old as fuck with a solo cup- oh no! Put down the blow, it's time to go pro. Shrimp, white wine, and hydrocodone. Sleep when you're dead, I took it to the heart. It'll be any day if I take it much farther. I'm a liquor cannibal, such a party animal. I'm a liquor cannibal, such a party animal. I'm a liquor cannibal, such a party animal. I'm a liquor cannibal, such a party animal- go! I've got poison flowing through my veins. All I want is more- what does that say? It's the quiet ones that you should worry about. Bark on bitches, let them hear you howl! I like that advice, I'll sing it to 'em all. Too bad I read it on a bathroom stall. Sleep when you're dead, I took it to the heart. It'll be any day if I take it much farther. I'm a liquor cannibal, such a party animal. I'm a liquor cannibal, such a party animal. I'm a liquor cannibal, such a party animal. I'm a liquor cannibal, such a party animal- go! There's no need to make it home tonight. Keep straight on until the morning light.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a8735W8qj6M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a8735W8qj6M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a8735W8qj6M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a8735W8qj6M/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":537,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"a8735W8qj6M"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/5BJticVzQtxUWKoCLY4KVGxLgJY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm5XTjlDTUhaM0FV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-15T02:40:50.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Calling Kings - \"I'm Not Fine\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Calling Kings - \"I'm Not Fine\" - Like this video?

Words can be sharper than a sword Words can be sharper than a sword But this words can be sharper than a sword, But words can't even touch you. Like leaves in the wind Like leaves in the wind And now I know, the thoughts you got enemies, that i can't fight And I for sure know, the unspoken words fading monuments, that won't return But this words can be sharper than a sword, But words can't even touch you.

I try to keep my head on straight, try to be fine day by day, try not to fight and keep it right, but fightings all we do these days, a lucid dream of losing face, can't keep up with the hastened pace, as you turned and walked away, now all that love has been replaced, \nscattered to the wind, there and back again, flattered by the words of another man, I swear you were my best friend, I'll never look you in the eyes again, a bitter end was never my plan so please try and understand, who knows if we'll ever ever ever be the same again, maybe, just maybe\n\nToo long I’ve been trying, investing my life into something you’re not buying, sick of saying sorry, no matter what i do now, I’m never gonna be good enough for you. \n\nI don’t miss you anymore, no longer fucked up don’t really care anymore, so long goodbye, time for new memories, I’m over it baby, this no longer means a thing to me \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9JzaYvbOMC4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9JzaYvbOMC4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9JzaYvbOMC4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9JzaYvbOMC4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9JzaYvbOMC4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":549,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9JzaYvbOMC4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/f1gVKpNVz2AsZET2p9G3A1n-J4I\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm52NF9uS0xKZkZ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-09T01:04:37.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Søndag - \"Rather Stay in the Dark\" Manifest Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Søndag - \"Rather Stay in the Dark\" - Like this video?

Swim, swim, swim!  x2\n \nUntil then we will swim against the tide\nSearching for the freedom we fear has died\nEmpowered by the hope we feel inside\nWe’ll land on solid ground this time\n \nWe were there for the thrill\nWe live with the drive\nWe live with the passion\nSurviving the trauma\nTo keep us alive\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwuxZMZareo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwuxZMZareo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwuxZMZareo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwuxZMZareo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwuxZMZareo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":558,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"dwuxZMZareo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/wcCD1ZzGM1Xyk3ATD1vsMHrsiwg\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnlvUkEySVdQTlU0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-29T23:03:14.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"#Goals - \"Squishy Anthem\" DC-Jam Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - #Goals - \"Squishy Anthem\" - Like this video?

But what if we found a way to mesh the two together in such a unique way that listeners can barely tell the difference? I mean isn’t it Obvious that the world of hip hop turned low frequency rap is in desperate need of a subliminal change for the better? Well look no further, he has arrived. Fort Worth, TX native Obvious is the most refreshing best of both worlds artist hip hop has seen in decades! Although, due to his plethora of talents its probably much more fair to label him as the best of “most” worlds. Producer, singer, song writer, rapper Obvious boasts a quadruple entourage of threats powerful enough to kill a room filed with today’s most successful trap & pop rappers. His silky smooth vocals layered upon truffles of dope beats topped off with lyrical substance and club appeal is always geniously done. Having worked with countless artists in DFW his reputation grows with each masterpiece he creates. Venues from D-Town to Abilene & Austin TX have all been greatful to have featured such an amazing talent. There’s an Obvious uniqueness in this artists sound that begs the world to listen while somewhat softening hardened hearts in a profound way. Obvious seems to be a selfless gift passed down to humanity by the divine just in time to stop the clock on its scheduled self destruction via thoughtless rap culture. And some how he doesn’t even stop there. This unique specimen has an alter ego who goes by the name of Quartz and is one half of the hip hop duo The ODdz. Joined by his female counterpart Amithyst the two have seamlessly committed to aiding in the destruction of watered down hip hop while “moving like water, mind over matter” as their legendary “Bruce Lee” single suggests. No wonder major record labels like AMG Universal are scrambling to lock in such greatness. The world couldn’t wait any longer. Destiny is upon us and it is definitely Obvious that his time is now!\n\nDirector Name: @KingZelFilms\nProducer Name: @Obvious2g\n\nAbout the Video:U only live once plus life is short can't be playing it's No Game\n\nYouTube Link https://youtu.be/Y9xRbGxph5o\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/obvious2gtv\nTwitter: @Obvious2g\nInstagram:Obvious2g\n\nLabel Name: Aye1 & Authentic Ink\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twyMmbAdV8c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twyMmbAdV8c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twyMmbAdV8c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twyMmbAdV8c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twyMmbAdV8c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":560,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"twyMmbAdV8c"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/sNmjlcOxwmKgRe579mPaEwrzvqY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkVpS0xFaVRjbndn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-29T01:55:22.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Chernobyl the Secret - \"Ego's Stronghold\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Chernobyl the Secret - \"Ego's Stronghold\" - Like this video?

Consciously aware. Emotionally devoid. Chained my psyche to misery. Too fast I lose my grip on reality. Shattered pieces of what I have always been reflect back an image of sorrows son. Shattered pieces of what I have always been reflect back an image of sorrows son. The looking glass self professes a weakness I cant seem too escape. An entity made of my own creation devouring me piece by piece. Piece by piece. Maybe it’s myself I'm afraid to see. Maybe it’s myself I'm afraid to be. Pull back the mask and reveal my higher self. Drown in self reflection. My mind keeps swimming with no apparent shore. I've collapsed underneath the weight of it all. The pillars that gave me strength fade away and disintegrate. The pillars that gave me strength fade away and disintegrate. This state of being is all ive ever know. Its cessation reforms the inner me. Separate myself from false claims. Disengage from the negativity festering inside of me. Psychological suicide. I must hold on to something or find purpose in the unknown. My mind keeps swimming with no apparent shore.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EiKLEiTcnwg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EiKLEiTcnwg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EiKLEiTcnwg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EiKLEiTcnwg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EiKLEiTcnwg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":561,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"EiKLEiTcnwg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Zgt-gN29WCIgrXLXuQwZX2qbDUs\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlVVTzdIckMtN0Y4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-29T01:46:22.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns - \"The Way Out\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Brighter Than a Thousand Suns - \"The Way Out\" - Like this video?

Lost days of youthful pining for success have taught us that the music is all that matters. Each day brings another possibility to strengthen our distinctive rendition of metal.\n    A desire to craft aggressive yet technical music has culminated in songs that seamlessly blend elements of thrash and modern progressive metal for a mind-bending assault on the senses.\nBy Conquest Or Consent first emerged in 2012 and we have since refined the line-up to forge a brotherhood of five like-minded musicians who live to enthrall a crowd.\n   After recording debut album 'Empires' with Studio 6 producer Stu McKay in 2012, By Conquest Or Consent secured a coveted slot for a Techfest show in London during March 2013. A debut music video then came with the release of 'Three' later in 2013. \n    By Conquest Or Consent’s uncompromising philosophy has continued to demand attention, with the band playing numerous shows throughout Ireland. A sold-out hometown show with metal legends Anthrax in July 2014 was a life-changing moment for the band. But not before an album release at HMV’s flagship Belfast store later in the year.\n    Focus and dedication continued to pay off in 2015. By Conquest Or Consent released a second music video in We Came To Bring The Fight before capturing support slots for luminaries like Chelsea Grin, Arnocorps, Heart of a Coward and Evil Scarecrow.\n\nThe evolution will continue…\n\nProducer Name: JSR Audio\n\nAbout the Video: Audio Preview\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/byconquestorconsent\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/bcocofficial\nInstagram: @byconquestorconsent\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/igkjyHpL_gQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/igkjyHpL_gQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/igkjyHpL_gQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/igkjyHpL_gQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":565,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"igkjyHpL_gQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/FNbtxGbknaLRmfDDxyu6PjCVn5A\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnVMaldlck0tbUkw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-23T23:37:51.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Starcutter - \"File Not Found\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Starcutter - \"File Not Found\" - Like this video?

Bantunani is well known for his live performances with his funky and afro dances. Some of his songs made him also known as activism. He has released seven regular studio albums, mostly through his own label company Blackninja  Publishing and has toured internationally.  Bantunani conceive his music as a creative platform around musicians and engineer like Bob Katz, Bernie Grundman, Brian Gardner and Jean Loup Morette from studios Davout with who he used to work for mix at Studios Davout. He is also reached world top charts four times with songs like Kivustan, Letthemtalk, LookBack and African Groovin.\nOne is intrigued listening to this wild group with vindictive and melancholic undertones. This « multiracial » group proposes a nu-rumba concept based on afro-groove fusion, where afro-rhythms meet hip-hop, funk, soul, and jazz. The group’s songs are powerful and aware. Bantunani’s music is both a consciousness raising and a dancing music.\nUnder the driving force of Michel Nzau, the group is a perfect blend between traditional and modern rhythms where every member brings in his or her own musical culture. The group is in perpetual re-evaluation of its artistic approach vis-a-vis its artistic and humanistic goals.\n\nDirector Name:  Michel Nzau VUANDA and Kristobane\nProducer Name: Michel Nzau VUANDA\n\nAbout the Video: \"Passion Gone\" and \"Passion Lost\" which announces the 8th studio album of the singer. On a very disco-pop Bantunani beat plunges us into a melancholy groove with unstoppable and effective melody. Far from the shackles, the singer signs a very strong radio and dancefloor title which announces a neat album.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.bantunani.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bantugroove\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bantunani\n\nLabel Name: BLACKNINJA PUBLISHING\n\nSong Lyrics:\nPASSION GONE V2 - BANTUNANI\nBy Michel Nzau - Album Musicalist\nCan you feel the groove\nWhen I bring you love\nCan you feel the pain\nlost in shame\nCan you feel it\nThis passion gone\nI’ve tried so hard\nTo forgive you\nand Never refused \nto let you go away\nNow, you are walking with someone else\nSo far that I can't see you face\nI wish I were blind\nWhen you turned back\nI couldn’t whisper through your ears\n\nCan you feel the groove\nWhen I bring you love\nCan you feel the beat \nDown on your knees\nCan you feel it \nwhat you’ve done to me\n\nThere is another story\nWhen a man like bb\nfall in love again\nJust because of you\nRefrain 2/\nCan you feel the groove\nWhen I bring you love\nCan you feel my pain\nLost in your train\nCan you feel it\nThis passion Gone\nCan you feel it\nWhat you’ve done to me yeah\nThis passion gone\nIt’s gone for real\nit’s gone for ever\nOh babe, oh babe, lady\nGive me back your heart\n\nYou have changed \nall of my world\nAnd gave me\nSuch passion\nThat it can not die in vain\nNow you are talking to someone else\nSo far that I can hear your voice\nI wish I were blind \nwhen you turn back\njust to whisper through your ear\nCan you feel the Groove\nWhen I bring you Love\nCan you feel the beat\nDown on your feet\nCan you feel it\nthis passion gone\nCan you feel it \nwhat you’ve done to me\ngive me back your hear\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vv2bvZ7_Kmg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vv2bvZ7_Kmg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vv2bvZ7_Kmg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vv2bvZ7_Kmg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vv2bvZ7_Kmg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":569,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"vv2bvZ7_Kmg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/nAS29BROIZScsjpWo40rcHT4yYM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnRnWlBjYzBseUtZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-23T20:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Weesp - \"Illumination\" Zeppelin Records - A BlankTV Feature!","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Weesp - \"Illumination\" - Like this video?

Weesp music is about finding individuals own path in the endless sea, about hard choices, about dreams and passion, about being different.\nMusic style is often described as progressive atmospheric alternative metal with analog synth and clean vocals \n\nArtist Biography: Lex (vocals), Mike (guitar) and Mi (bass) started playing music together in school in 2003. \nAfter recording the second EP 'Taste of Steel' in 2009, the band has finally announced its name: WEESP.\nBy the beginning of work on the next EP (in 2011), 'This Will Destroy Us', two more band members - Gul (drums) and Mi's twin brother Stak (electronics) joined the team, to finalize the current structure of WEESP.\n\nDuring 2012-2015 Weesp have performed at numerous concerts and festivals, including those in Baltic countries, all over CIS, Poland, Germany and Czech Republic. The band has released three EPs and two singles\n\nIn 2015 the band released their first long play album \\\"The Void\\\", produced by Wieslawski brothers at Hertz Records (Behemoth, Decapitated, Vader). The album was released August 20, 2015 and features 13 songs, two singles done in collaboration with Cory Brandan from Norma Jean.\n\nWeesp often say that The Void - is endless sea, in which every person should make it’s own way, or get lost, becoming ‘noone’. From that time Weesp sometimes name themselves as the ship ‘Weesp’ that travels around endless sea of ‘Void’ struggling the waves and finding new people to take on board.\n\nBand was touring across Europe (Poland, Germany, Czech Republic) in 2015-2017.\n\nNow Weesp is working on the second album \\\"Black Sails\\\" coming out early 2018. The album is produced by Wieslawski brothers.\n\nDuring the album promo campaign Weesp started to name their fans community as Black Sails, and each fan individually as sailor. The ‘Black Sails’ album will stand against the pressure of the society opinion on the people who wants to be different, against witch hunting and mass cultural dictatorship. \n\n \nAbout the Video: The music video shooting was fun, cold and ice braking.\nThe main idea is:\nWe were born to be happy. You should keep working and believing in yourself even if nobody is for you. You should stay strong and self-confident. Everyday we struggle with different situations which shackle us and suppresses us.

BlankTV.com!\n \n***\nJoe Taylor - \"You Won't Pass Go\" Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.\n\nArtist Biography:  Seattle-based singer/songwriter Joe Taylor has spent the last few years fronting hard-rock band Versus, who released their debut album in the spring of 2017 and toured with acts like Ryan Cabrera, Rookie of the Year, and Sparks the Rescue, among others. Inspired by artists ranging from Julien Baker and Noah Gundersen to Brand New, Taylor uses his music as an emotional outlet, aiming to put raw feelings on the line for fans to connect with and understand. \nEveryone goes through hardships in life and this solo project is the platform Taylor has decided to use to talk about his. An advocate of mental health, Taylor sees the importance in working with suicide awareness and prevention organizations such as To Write Love On Her Arms and Golden Gate Bridge Suicide Prevention, as well as Survivors of Suicide which he has worked with alongside Versus, for when you're feeling helpless and alone. He shares, \"I created this project as another outlet for songs I've been writing and wanted to have more of a softer, emotional sound. I wrote these songs for anyone who is going through something that seems impossible and who can relate to the experiences that I sing about. Life sucks sometimes but it's easier when you know that you're not alone in your struggles.\" In late 2017, Taylor debuted his first solo-track titled \"Flagstaff\" which touches on the difficulty of making a relationship work when one partner is struggling with severe depression. Just one of many topics he hopes to dive into with his solo music, Taylor plans on using this project to cope with his struggles, helping him deal with anxiety and inner demons while relating to others and helping them along the way. \n\nAbout the Video: \"You Won't Pass Go\" was written from a female perspective in the never-ending quest for happiness. You explore, you love, you hurt. It's a cycle of finding yourself, but some of us don't want to be found. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Joetaylortunes/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/joe_vs_himself/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvClo24BG8Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvClo24BG8Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvClo24BG8Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvClo24BG8Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvClo24BG8Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":575,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"cvClo24BG8Y"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/w0Vgqko2GRInuR3iW534ma0Cy9w\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnRpV1l4QVRXenFZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-22T03:32:34.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Pale Black - \"Back to the Light\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Pale Black - \"Back to the Light\" - Like this video?

Una formazione essenziale: chitarra, basso e batteria, un power trio. Nasce a luglio dalle ceneri di molte altre band, tante da farci pensare che La Bufera sia uno stato di fatto delle nostre vite: non ci si ferma mai, tutto cambia. E’ proprio questo che vogliamo raccontare, perché a volte il cambiamento è una salvezza e urlarlo accompagnati da suoni distorti ci fa stare bene. \n\nDirector Name: Minocci Art\n\nArtist Website: http://www.labufera.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/LaBuferaBand/\nBandCamp: https://www.labufera.bandcamp.com/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"17\"\n\nDovrei scavare con i denti e i complimenti a chi per uscire di qua toglie ogni tua libertà. Ora chi mi ama mi chiede se ho pulito il piatto. Non ho vertigini a guardare giù, da sopra ora ho una ragione in più. Vorrei trasformare ogni avversità che c’è in problemi semplici, disegnare con te linee curve sugli angoli. Sarei disposto a creder che nel mondo ci sia solo tu. Non è difficile, un po’ inutile, sapere che non ci sarai più. Mentre ti sporgi dall’ottavo piano e ti ripeti che li dentro tu solo sei sano. Mentre ti sporchi i polsi piano piano e ti ripeti che li dentro tu solo sei sano. Potrei scardinare il pensiero d’esser adeguato a te che sei perfetta e senza macchia. In equilibrio sulle uova, mi sembra di tornare a scuola, ripetizioni non servite, probabilmente anche quest’anno non ce la farai. Mentre ti sporgi dall’ottavo piano e ti ripeti che li dentro tu solo sei sano. Mentre ti sporchi i polsi piano piano e ti ripeti che li dentro tu solo sei sano.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be25dm_2af8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be25dm_2af8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be25dm_2af8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be25dm_2af8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be25dm_2af8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":578,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"be25dm_2af8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/7uJ_nR10IIa6RrFuvCkh39w3PuA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk9CaWp0VUl1MFJF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-22T00:27:50.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Hexcore - \"Empty Inside\" feat.

Their self-produced EP, 'Orenda', debuted in 2013. \n\nSince then, the band has performed at numerous venues in the Northern California area. The group released their second EP, 'Lifestyle', in September 2014.  The title track was featured on 98 Rock's Local Licks program for three weeks running. Lifestyle's \"Apocalypse\" was released soon after and earned a spot on 98 Rock's Local Licks Most Liked Song of 2014 Countdown Show.  The song came in at #2 for the year!\n\nFollowing the successes of 'Lifestyle', the band entered the studio with Sacramento engineer and producer Matt Thomas to record their first full-length album, 'Open Fire', which was released in October of 2015.\n\n'Open Fire' was well received following its release, garnering overwhelmingly positive reviews from a wide variety of writers and music critics. The song \"Heaven\" was the #6 Most Liked Song of 2015 for 98 Rock's Local Licks, despite only having two months of airplay during the year.\n\nThe group is well known for their musicality and showmanship. Shows are high-energy, engaging, and memorable. Their musical range is impressive, with an ability to provide anything from an incredible rock show to an unforgettable metal experience, for any venue's style and crowd.

This tour stretched from coast to coast, passing through thirteen states and twenty-one cities shortly after releasing a version of \"Not Your Savior\" (No Use for a Name’s song), which ended up in a documentary about the legendary American label, Fat Wreck Chords.\nDuring these years, Abraskadabra have been always standing ground into relevant concerts, sharing the stage with all these great bands: Bad Religion, Rise Against, Flogging Molly, Fishbone, Streetlight Manifesto, Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, Pauline Black (The Selecters), Goldfinger, The Toasters, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Satanic Surfers, are some to name.\nIt isn’t just the 15-years on the road that settle the power and unity of Abraskadabra, but also the energy and passion they put into the music they create, being friends first and putting together one of the most solid and interesting Brazilian band nowadays.\"\n\nDirected by Thiago Prestes DOP by Thiago Vilas Boas Production Management by Daniane Almeida Production by Thiago Vilas Boas, Eduardo Alves and Abraskadabra Color grading: Tiago Gavas Finishing: Leonardo Scholz Supported by Genilson Moreti, André Albuquerque, Eduardo Alves and Luba Freitas Song recorded, mixed and mastered by Thiago Trosso at Brothers Room Audio Recordings, London UK -- 2017 Special thanks to Alme, Déko, Alema, Eigon Pirolo, Rodrigo Pinheiro and all the wonderful people that came and helped making the best video possible\n\nArtist Website: http://www.abraskadabra.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/abrascwb\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abraskadabra\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/abraskadabra\nSPOTIFY: http://spoti.fi/2ArXHjd\nDEEZER: http://bit.ly/2AqMI9v\n\nLabel Name: Independent, so far\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Heavy Hitters\"\n\n\"And I’m OK I say what I say ‘cause I wanna say it I’m never backing down and give in all the pressure They say NEVER GIVE UP Cut that sentimental crap ‘cause you live for the Money I say what I say when I wanna say it I’ll give you summer teeth and a bag of tomatoes BUT WHY?

George Holman, who records under the moniker Peacock Affect, is an exception to that rule - not only is the Exeter, UK-based musician his own harshest critic—he’s discerning about which songs see the light of day. In Holman’s hands, his influences feel new, thanks to impeccable, spacious arrangements that give the music room to breathe. Holman is a versatile vocalist with expressive range; he’ll switch from keening falsetto to a low-register growl, sometimes in the same song. Peacock Affect’s music is successful because of its purity and lack of artifice, Holman isn’t afraid to make himself vulnerable, but he does so with purpose and clarity. “Usually, I have piles of lyrics next to my bed and poems I write on my phone—just random lines and stuff,” he says. “I just enjoy writing songs when I feel like it, when the moment takes me,” he continues. “It’s important that I write a song when I feel like writing a song, not when I have to or need to. It’s definitely the way forward—for me, anyway. I’ve heard Eminem apparently goes in the studio, and they just work at it. He writes great stuff, but that’s just not the way I work. I just do it when I feel like it. I feel that’s the way most art should be made.”—Annie Zaleski \n\nArtist Website: http://www.peacockaffect.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/peacockaffect\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/peacockaffect\nBandCamp: https://peacockaffectmusic.bandcamp.com/track/straight-into-the-rails\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/peacockaffect\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/peacockaffect\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/peacockaffect\nContact: peacockaffect@gmail.com\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8yoPNS9Cti8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8yoPNS9Cti8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8yoPNS9Cti8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8yoPNS9Cti8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8yoPNS9Cti8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":592,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"8yoPNS9Cti8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/xYp_4msZHsCLUEcHAPZ5zCUUcoE\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Li1LeFc4V3B6UkVJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-17T23:30:00.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Colonel Sun - \"Lullaby\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Colonel Sun - \"Lullaby\" - Like this video?

A time machine? Unlikely. A midlife crisis? Perhaps.\nEither way, Colonel Sun is the brainchild of Montreal-native Scott Cook (formerly Dead Days, Ablyss, Bodyjarr). On the edge of abandonment, Scott realized that he had a few more stories to tell. So, armed with his guitar, his voice, and his laptop, he took a journey through a mind full of memories, anecdotes, and sarcasm. To Scott's surprise, this journey culminated in an invasion of sorts—a suburban invasion, in fact—and, in the blink of an eye, a musical battle plan had been laid. Proudly, Scott promoted himself to Colonel. However, he quickly realized that an invasion of this scale could not be fought alone. Enter longtime comrades Mishka Stein and Robbie Kuster (of Patrick Watson) as well as Simon Angell (of Thus Owls). Without hesitation, this fearless trio assumed their stations and the four brave soldiers entered the battlefield...\nNow, Montreal-based Colonel Sun is a rock n' roll band, inspired by music that is charged by feel and emotion. Compared to bands such as Mudhoney, Failure, and Helmet, Colonel Sun clearly runs on fuel from the '90s. However, the members' collective musical background is so eclectic that the band's dirty-rock edge is, at times, polished by musically-progressive overtones. \n \nSince the release of Colonel Sun's debut EP, 'Suburban Invasion' (released April 2017), the band has been receiving positive attention that has included airplay (CHOM 97.7, CJLO, CKUT) and interviews (Bucketlist Music Reviews), and has performed at local venues including Turbo Haus, Barfly, La Vitrola, and Bar Le Ritz. The band just opened up for New York hardcore legend Harley Flanagan (CroMags) at Coop Katacombs, and will perform at Pouzza Fest 2018. So keep an ear out, 'cause this battle has only just begun!!\n\nDirector Name: Scott Cook\nProducer Name: Scott Cook\n\nAbout the Video: ”Lullaby” is a simple story about a challenge that any driver faces in the hustle and bustle of the modern world: staying awake. There’s no hidden message here… Just keep your eyes open, or get off the road!\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/colonelsunband\nBandCamp: http://colonelsun.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: @colonelsunband\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Lullaby\"\n\nI feel my lids start to close. \nNodding off to the gentle hum\nOf the engine that carries me home. \nLong day, white noise, bright lights,\nred bags holding black dots\nI gotta get off the road. \nJust gotta get off the road. \nI feel tired so they're tryin' to shut;\nStation's playing my favourite bedtime track.\nPerfect tune to cuddle up,\nBut wrong place, bad time to nap. \nI gotta get off the road. \nJust gotta get off the road.\nLoosen my grip on the wheel,\nDrift away into another world.\nPeaceful dreams of blue skies along the coast\nWrong way, think fast, too late,\nblack bag holding my dust. \nShould've got off the road. \nJust should've got off the road.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-KxW8WpzREI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-KxW8WpzREI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-KxW8WpzREI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-KxW8WpzREI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-KxW8WpzREI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":593,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-KxW8WpzREI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/LyUM1ZwGCHNFeC2bPhpydiPt5MY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjFjaWVZaENtQ0Zr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-19T04:36:44.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Young Hearts - \"Smoke\" Primordial Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Young Hearts - \"Smoke\" - Like this video?

Never interested in trend-hopping or idly posturing, Evertim are a band entirely dedicated to their music.  A delicate blend of aggressive emo-tinged rock and gorgeous melodies that elevates their music beyond prototypical pop-punk norms. \n \n\"I think our message is best conveyed live\" explains vocalist/guitarist, Alex Tuck. \"There is no bravado, no gimmicks. You will always be able to see us smiling our heads off having the best time on stage. I think that attitude really resonates in our music\". \n \nHailing from Brighton, UK,  Evertim's songs have attracted attention not just at a local level, but also nationally with airplay on the world famous BBC Radio 1 Rock Show.  DJ Daniel P. Carter selecting their single 'Knots' for airplay, after a chance meeting brought them together. \n \n“Ben and Georgia got talking to Daniel about our plans for the year at a Masterclass at their college and gave him a copy of our EP ‘Learn to Swim’. We didn’t really think much of it, but next thing we know he tweets us the morning of the show telling us he was going to be playing our track ‘Knots’. We couldn't believe it!\"\n \nSpurred on by the experience, the band began touring and preparing their next batch of songs. Treading in the footsteps of trailblazing UK bands like Creeper, Milk Teeth and Boston Manor they chose to record with producer Neil Kennedy at The Ranch, cutting the down the four tracks which would become 'Your Heaven Held Me Well'.  Talking about the experience Alex explains:\n \n\"This time around we really focused on the drum sounds to set a solid foundation for the record. Neil and Daly (George) are perfectionists and really made sure we had the best possible tones. After drum tracking, we went to Southampton to see Montroze and Luke Rainsford play a house show. The timing couldn't have been more perfect as we managed to convince Luke to do guest vocals on 'The Road We Claim Our Own'\". \n \nAlthough heavily influenced by the more 'sensible' end of pop-punk and hardcore - artists like The Early November, Have Mercy, Pentimento and Aaron West- Evertim still happily call the UK Pop-Punk scene their home. Giving praise to the network of bands, promoters and fans that allowed them to share stages with bands like Holding Absence, Homebound and Dream State and also to cross paths with their current label, Fox Records. \n \n\"Over the last year we've been lucky enough to support some incredible bands and meet some amazing people.  JD at Fox was enthusiastic and so into the record and we are so excited to be on the same roster as bands like Better Than Never, Coast To Coast and Layover\". \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/evertimband\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/evertimband\nMerch: http://www.evertim.bigcartel.com/\n\nLabel Name: Fox Records\nLabel Website: http://foxrecords.limitedrun.com/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVecWhnkcVI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVecWhnkcVI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVecWhnkcVI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVecWhnkcVI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVecWhnkcVI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":598,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FVecWhnkcVI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/NncajCAhFLbkv9PkJCpqqbLFhss\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmJDcGJMajNKdkFj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-18T20:44:46.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Veliu Namai & Sen Svaja - \"Leliumoj\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Veliu Namai & Sen Svaja - \"Leliumoj\" - Like this video?

Mixing southwestern boogie, desert-worn blues, retro-metal assault and fierce rocking into a sound that screams Texas–at times sanguine and starkly beautiful, at others full of damn sexy groove and assaulting violence can only describe the music of Texan power rocking, fuzzed out stoner blues trio, Switchblade Jesus. \n\nDirector Name: Jay Hooke\nProducer Name: Jay Hooke \n\nAbout the Video: Texas’ Switchblade Jesus will appear on the seventh addition of Ripple Music’s The Second Coming of Heavy, splitting the release with Fuzz Evil. To go along with that, the band has unveiled a brand new animated music video for “Heavy Is the Mountain,” one of three contributions to Switchblade Jesus’ side of the split.\nThe video was done by Jay Hooke, and it looks like a bizarre cross between an old Steamboat Willy cartoon and a bad acid trip.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.switchbladejesus.net\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SwitchbladeJesus\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/the_switchblade\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/switchbladejesus \nBandCamp: https://www.switchbladejesus.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/switchbladejesus\n\nLabel Name: Ripple Music\nLabel Website: http://www.ripple-music.com/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8nb8JzM-5o/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8nb8JzM-5o/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8nb8JzM-5o/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8nb8JzM-5o/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8nb8JzM-5o/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":600,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"H8nb8JzM-5o"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/s8ZigSZVCESB3WuwhlB6JQ-iaco\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmFScXh4bUw3bXFn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-16T20:49:58.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Bare Minimum - \"The Only Thing You Can Keep\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Bare Minimum - \"The Only Thing You Can Keep\" - Like this video?

Moon is known for her fearless approach to creativity and the ability to stay ahead of music trends that keeps her sound fresh and exciting. CHROME is the follow-up to her critically praised 2016 release Pantomania, and was produced by Betty Moon and members of her band. “The idea behind CHROME was to project a beautiful, destructive and sexy concept of what life can be like when there is nothing holding you back. The drama, success and passion for music all come together with this album. Each song was pieced together to tell a story that is bigger than you could imagine.”\nWith multiple major label and independent releases under her belt, Moon thinks only about what’s next and ensures she always keeps her music fun, innovative and well produced. In addition, she has shared the stage and collaborated with many of today’s top producing, recording and film industry talent.\n \nKnown for her sultry voice, rock n’ roll attitude and visionary appeal, Moon is an always-evolving tour de force. Her first album deal was with A&M Records, and her self-titled debut LP was released while living and touring throughout Canada. She has been nominated for four CASBY Awards including Best Album of the Year, Best Single of the Year, Best Video of the Year, and Best Artist of the Year. Moon released multiple records after her debut album, which includes Doll Machine), Stir, Demon Flowers and multiple releases via her label Evolver Music including Rollin’ Revolution, Amourphous and Pantomania.\n \nIn 2010, Moon relocated to Los Angeles and released her 5th album Rollin’ Revolution, which garnered airplay on famed L.A. rock radio station KROQ. In 2013, Moon was a featured artist at the Sunset Strip Music Festival, sharing the stage with Marilyn Manson, Quiet Riot and The Offspring.\n \nIn 2017, Betty was written up as one of the Top Five Trending Female Artists and Celebrity Café Hollywood quotes as saying “Her mesmerizing melodies and high energy hooks place her among modern greats like Tove Lo and Jess Glynn”. Betty has been busy setting the stage for the August 25th release of her latest studio album, CHROME, and has unveiled a series of singles and remixes from the album paired with music videos that take the viewer down the rabbit hole of her larger-than-life style, lyrics and sound. Her latest single “Life Is But A Dream” premiered recently via Our Culture Magazine and is now available via online retailers.\n \nCHROME’s first single “Sound” was released in March and has since gone international. Betty has signed two non-exclusive music distribution and licensing agreements whereby her music will reach more than 150 million consumers each day through more than 500,000 subscriber locations in 100 plus countries around the globe.\n\nBetty Moon’s music will be now be heard by consumers and fans worldwide in retail locations including: the Gap, Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Starbucks, Uniqlo, McDonald’s, IKEA, North Face, Aloft Hotels, The Body Shop, Steve Madden and Nordstrom’s worldwide.\n\nDirector Name: Evolver Music, Inc.\n\nAbout the Video: New live music style video for \"Natural Disaster\".\n\nArtist Website: http://www.bettymoon.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BettyMoonmusic/\n\nLabel Name: Evolver Music, Inc.\nLabel Website: https://www.evolvermusicinc.com/ \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1VE7ivFakXc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1VE7ivFakXc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1VE7ivFakXc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1VE7ivFakXc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1VE7ivFakXc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":609,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"1VE7ivFakXc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/yKvwKpahGeH0WQuLlymXYjb9n2g\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkZ5bU5fbE9BOURn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-15T00:06:55.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Soy Suspenso - \"Mártir\" Lock and Load Records","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Soy Suspenso - \"Mártir\" - Like this video?

Against the contentment of his parents he autodidactically learned to play guitar and had started his first band at the age of 18, which has awoken his interest in flamenco and classic guitar. Afterwards he founded his first professional band Octav, which was successful in his home country. He was playing a great number of concerts at that time and released an album along with various singles. In addition to that he was directing and producing one of the first Iranian Hip-Hop music videos ever. Because of the political and religious situation this kind of music is very controversial in Iran, but nonetheless there can be found an active and functioning local underground scene. ASHLEE.K studied music theory with the focus on Rock, Jazz and Blues at the ‘Conservatory of Music‘ academy in Teheran. He was producing and composing music for underground as well as major artists in Teheran and elsewhere. Because of his work he came in contact with a various range of musical input, which finally led to his detection of electronic music. The “New Heights“ project came to life two years ago with one final goal: to produce a great EDM album featuring as many international artists from various countries as possible, like England, Romania, Israel and the US or even Iran on it. ASHLEE.K is proving once more that music is able to push boundaries and to connect peoples. Due to this exceptional fusion the tracks includes influences from many genres like Eastern Folk, Classic or Dubstep. Together with catchy songs like the opener “Shut Up and Kiss Me“, “Loving You Easy“ or the title track \"New Heights\" ASHLEE.K is producing a perfect dance floor mood. His sound will catch you and is going to let you dance! Driving beats combined with emotional vocals will convince every listener. Next to titles like “Morning Stars“, “Make Me Crazy“ or “Every Body Wants Me“ the album includes instrumental versions of “New Heights“ and “Shut Up and Kiss Me“. Substantially the eleven songs relate to motives like beautiful women, love and the accompanying difficulties to that.\n\nDirector Name: Hamid Sahari\nProducer Name: Ashlee.k\n\nArtist Website: http://www.ashleek.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Ashlee.k.official\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ash.lee.k\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/ash_leek\n\nLabel Name: Dr. Music Promotion\nLabel Website: http://www.dr-music-promotion.de/?page_id=10256#english\n\nSong Lyrics: \"New Heights\"\n\nI'm high when\nYou're with me\nWant your love\nOn repeat\n\nYou got me feeling so high\nYou kiss my lips and I'm flying\nwe take this love to new heights\nyou got me feeling so high\n\nand I like the view from here\nno baby, I'm not scared\nyou're saving me from the fear\nI like the atmosphere\n\nhold on to me baby\nI have never been here before\nThis feeling that you giving me is crazy\nSomehow you just got me wanting more\n\ncatch me cause I'm falling for you\nit's too late to turn back now\n\nand I'm addicted to\nthe way I'm a match for you\nif you let me break through\nI'll show you a love that's true\n\nA love that's higher than the clouds\nA love that screams, a love that's loud\nA love that you just can't divide\nShow you a love that gets you high\n\nLyrics by Antonia Marquee \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9kXQ3IBAXso/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9kXQ3IBAXso/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9kXQ3IBAXso/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9kXQ3IBAXso/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9kXQ3IBAXso/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":624,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9kXQ3IBAXso"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/USiZfji2a5XWtBSb4RvSht7nEG0\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnRjMTdsOVNMVFhv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-06T02:06:46.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Shoplifters - \"Instant Forgiver\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Shoplifters - \"Instant Forgiver\" - Like this video?

If you wanna know exactly how tough it gets, just ask Shoplifters! These poor bastards have spent a significant number of their teens wandering around in the dark, moving from one straight edge band to another, from hardcore to ska-core, grindcore to street punk, sinking deeper and deeper to the dark side. Not even their parents saw any future for these kids, and instead of trying in vain they already started making funds for their drug rehab therapies or Krishna temple donations. Those were the sad times. Yet somehow, our heroes managed to get a grip on their lives and come back almost intact. Almost? Well, judge for yourselves from these fine words of one of the convalescents: ”Looking back, I think it was all punk rock… and emo, of course. It all originated from ska anyway!” Whatever.Anyway the important thing is that they were able to turn their backs on the dirt of the past tense and strive for something better in the days-to-come.\nSo, how on earth did these losers get together and started playing their twisted version of rock'n'roll music. Well, it's an epic story, as they usually are. It went pretty much like this: person A (the fat guy from the suburbs) met person B (the short one) and, in a typical boy-meets-girl scenario, one thing lead to another, their eyes met and then simultaniously turned towards the setting sun in a visionary manner, and the soon-to-be legend was born. The original members had found that their musical aspirations combined could make miracles and decided that they were to give their entire bodies and souls to the cause. Or, as one of the band members sais it eloquently: “We had nothing better to do”.\nIt was destiny.\n\nDirector Name: Shoplifters\nProducer Name: Aleksandar Jovanovic\n\nAbout the Video: Shoplifters cruising Danube\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/shopliftersi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Shopliftersi\nBandCamp: https://shoplifters.bandcamp.com/\n\nLabel Name: Brassneck Records, Waterslide Records, PopKid Records, White Russian Records, Bartolini Records\nLabel Website: http://popkidrecords.blogspot.rs/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Instant Forgiver\"\n\nNow, now, I tried to be on time \nTime flies in the friendly skies \nDark clouds away! \n\nYou know I hate a bad goodbye \nTried hard to pass another round \nThen one round again \n\nWords fish deep in the river \nPlease be my instant forgiver \nWords fish deep in the river \nPlease be my instant forgiver \n\nRight now we are worlds apart \nSomehow I'll try to turn the page \nI won't mess around \n\nBummed out waiting out the storm \nFresh start is all I'm asking for \nSo don't let me down \n\nWords fish deep in the river \nPlease be my instant forgiver \nWords fish deep in the river \nPlease be my instant forgiver \n\nForgiver, you are my, forgiver...\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tc17l9SLTXo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tc17l9SLTXo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tc17l9SLTXo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tc17l9SLTXo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tc17l9SLTXo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":625,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"tc17l9SLTXo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/OX3bOsuXOcH7huAYQ5h1tPoH8gM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkJUNkJ5Y2FKWXpn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-05T20:20:56.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Naioth - \"Sublimation\" Digmetalworld Records","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Naioth - \"Sublimation\" - Like this video?

He believes people should focus on spreading positive messages and be themselves by following whatever their passion is.\n\n“I love helping and listening to others,” he said. “I think that every single person has the potential to achieve great things. No matter what your social, sexual or religious affiliation is – or any other status – we’re all gonna’ make it. Just be yourself and follow your passion and push it to the limit.”\n\nLord Conrad’s new single, “Touch the Sky,” is a tribute to that artistic philosophy. He said the song comes from his honesty and the admiration he has for people with high character and who put in hard work. He said the single is a never-done-before “sonorous experiment,” a mix between trance, dance and EDM electronic music that features heavy beats with melodic stabs of electronic piano while showcasing his vocal skills.\n\n“Of course, the lyrics capture my sweet, eccentric, positive, lavish lifestyle perfectly,” he said. “On enthusiastic listener stated: ‘This is a masterpiece of musical art.’ And ‘Lord Conrad’s new music is a perfect combination of a two-time speed new generation lifestyle.’”\n\nDirector Name: Gabriel Cash\nProducer Name: Lord Conrad\n \nAbout the Video: The EDM Dance single \"Touch the Sky\" is currently getting a buzz in Italy and throughout Europe. Prior to releasing this single, Lord Conrad has been modeling, dancing and doing public relations events at clubs throughout Milan – the world fashion capital – for the past ten years and has been featured in Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Victex and a lot of editorial magazines. The music video is a short film directed by Gabriel Cash who has directed numerous films in Europe such as Destiny Angels and Red Mantis to name a few. The video was shot in Rome and features Johnny Zampa's Bastard Dolls. The Bastard Dolls are some of the hottest dancers in Rome, as they can be seen at the disco club where \"Touch the Sky\" was partially shot. The concept of the video is a short film featuring Lord Conrad and his girlfriend in a plot that sees Lord's girlfriend kidnapped by a gang of sexy girls who Lord has to fight to get her back.\n \nArtist Website: http://www.lordconrad.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/lordconradnasdaqgod\nTwitter: https://www.facebook.com/Conrad.Lord1\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/user-616881552\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/24TAlHoHg5TmXT7hqD2Pm9\nYoutube: http://www.lordconrad.com/youtubechannel\nBandCamp: https://itunes.apple.com/album/id1227943806?ls=1&app=itunes\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lordconraditaly/\n\nLabel Name: Lord Conrad\nLabel Website: http://www.lordconrad.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Touch the Sky\"\n\nWe were young and we were carefree we were wild into the night we were aiming higher, aiming higher.

He had been busy writing new material for his band of eight years called The Frail, and soon realized that it didn't quite fit. He began collaborating with Allen Davis (Every Move a Picture) on new material, and decided to leave San Francisco to New York to pursue Vacances. They officially got their start in Brooklyn when Danny linked up with longtime friend Nick Gonzalez (Guitar) and new life partners Dan Bindschedler (Bass) & Shaun Lowecki (Drums). The group has a rich, colorful, and eclectic musical history. Nick spent time in The Restless Hearts (Adeline Records), Chris was in Walking Shapes, and Dan played in Robin Bacior. Collectively, they've each toured around the world, played major music festivals such as BottleRock, SXSW, BFD, CMJ, Treasure Island Music Festival, Noise Pop, and have been featured on BlankTV, Fuse, Interview Magazine, Electronic Musician, Paste, NME and more. Debuting their first show at The Bowery Ballroom Feb/2016, these guys are taking the New York underground by storm with a fierce determination to create a name around Vacances.\n\nDirector Name: Jayson Martinovich\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/VacancesNY/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q02WM4zCQ30/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q02WM4zCQ30/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q02WM4zCQ30/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q02WM4zCQ30/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q02WM4zCQ30/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":644,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"q02WM4zCQ30"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/iJ2Xas2TZ7IwlmFYvCVK_-B5nVg\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LndrSW1VRW0zQW9N","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-29T05:14:05.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Helless - \"Produkt\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Helless - \"Produkt\" - Like this video?

Lois explains of the ambitious new concept record: \"'Exiled' is a collection of songs that we began writing after being struck by the misery of the European refugee crisis. Some of the songs are written from the perspectives of fictional characters of those impacted by the crisis, and others of those who prefer to distance themselves from it.\"\nLatest single \"Rorschach\" and previous tune \"Territories\" are just tasters of what to expect on 'Exiled'. With a record under their belts that is sure to open minds and spark debate, Drones don't plan on sitting on the fence politically or musically any time soon...\n \nArtist Website: http://thisisdrones.com/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/dronesuk\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/dronesuk\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/dronesuk\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/tremitchell/playlist/3RYmCoV8xtc9sE1gQaMGfI\n \nLabel Name: Lockjaw Records\nLabel Website: http://www.lockjawrecords.co.uk\n \nSong Lyrics: As we sit here writing poetry, the bullets tear through their skin\nThis world is so sick, prescribe the medication\nHang man and hide and seek, but they’re not playing games\nWe read it every day and roll our eyes\nYou always ignore them and turn the page\n\nYou don’t wake up to violence\nYou’ve got it good\nYou’ve got it good\nThey’ve got no hope of this modern romance\nThey never could\nThey never could\n\nComplain once more about your debts or the mirror that you stare into\nThey’re running from fatal threats\nJust try and imagine what they’re going through\nNo space between the hate\nOur problems hold no weight\nWe don’t even know the meaning of pain\n\nYou don’t wake up to violence\nYou’ve got it good\nYou’ve got it good\nThey’ve got no hope of this modern romance\nThey never could\nThey never could\n\nYou’re born with privilege so make the most of it\nYou’re so irrational\nGet a little perspective and take the best of it\nIt’s time to let it go\nYou’re born with privilege\nGet a little perspective\nYour disillusioned bliss\n\nYou don’t wake up to violence\nYou’ve got it good\nYou’ve got it good\nThey’ve got no hope of this modern romance\nThey never could\nThey never could\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BOUVBr6c8Rw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BOUVBr6c8Rw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BOUVBr6c8Rw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BOUVBr6c8Rw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BOUVBr6c8Rw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":650,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BOUVBr6c8Rw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/lZiIFR76RLGKGBAj4omyYY2TMCU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlZLaXhuVThkbTRJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-29T03:00:26.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Soy Suspenso - \"Rebelión\" Lock and Load Records","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Soy Suspenso - \"Rebelión\" - Like this video?

Fusing elements of post punk, emo, and melodic hardcore, the songs erupt with raw emotion, featuring dynamic vocals, blistering tempos, and unrelenting grooves. They draw influence from other edgy, melodically driven bands such as Alexisonfire, Refused, At The Drive In, and A Wilhelm Scream.\nNo Liars released their debut self-titled EP in March of 2015 enlisting the help of Jesse Gander of Rain City Recorders (Japandroids, White Lung, The Pack A.D) to mix, as well as Charles Carvalho of Joao Carvalho Mastering (Alexisonfire, Arkells, Silverstein, Protest the Hero).  Following this release they began touring in Canada and have shared the stage with legends in the punk scene like Anti-Flag, Gob and Teenage Bottlerocket.

Touring, dedication and sacrifice.\n\nThe success of 'Define Redemption' (2014) allows the band to embark in their first headline tour in Japan.\n\"Redemption over Japan 2014\" brings new soldiers to the REALITY GREY's army of headbangers in the Far East.\nThe band has toured in the past with: Municipal Waste, Unearth, Sick Of It All, Malevolent Creation, Deicide, Hatesphere, Sadist, Destrage.\n\nDirector Name: Manuela Nicoletti\nProducer Name: Reality Grey\n\nAbout the Video: An old man thinks about his past life, and all the struggle that brings with it. He recalls and dreams about all the stages of life that brought him to the end, from being a man, a boy and a child, only to realize that the end is near. When the time has come, if you believe in yourself, it can turn into a new beginning.

BlankTV.com!\n \n***\nLandmine Heart - \"No Direction Home\" Aggrobeat Records - Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: Arnhem, The Netherlands\n\nArtist Biography: Landmine Heart, a four-headed Dutch punk beast consisting of members who served the last twenty years in bands like: Beans, Strike First, Shaggable Sluts, The Yuppies and Bitter Grounds. All the members have been playing in bands since the ‘90s and this history combined with the groups ability to draw from different punk genres, enables the creation of a catchy sing-along sound that will make sure that any audience feels like they are part of the show. Landmine Heart plays highly energetic punk rock. Mix this with the attitude of The Damned and The Stooges, the anger of Black Flag, the sleaze of The Hellacopters and the power of Motörhead, then you get the explosive sound of Landmine Heart: Anthemic, filled with hooks and with lyrics relating to real life, a style firmly embedded in the historic roots of punk.\n Originated/Jinxed in 2010 after the demise of their old bands. Landmine Heart was all set to conquer the scene but a series of setbacks: dead, depressions, addictions, raising a family, marriages, divorces or other bands, all conspired against the band and the momentum was lost. Or one could say “life took over”. An occasional gig here and there and a rough and rowdy live recording, made with a iphone, was the only sign of life of the band in years. But that recording and the shows gained them enough credits not to die a silent dead.\n In late 2016, the band returned invigorated with a new understanding of itself and pumped with a year’s worth of frustration. Jinxed from the start and more dead than alive the band reclaimed the stage and took no prisoners. But what once was a gathering of punks, skins, bikers, junkies, lowlifes and non-specified, was turned into an artfair for beggars and hangers-on. The smell of sweat and danger was replaced by the smell of roses and patchouli. The sound of the streets turned into the sound of art-school trendies who cry and whine and the only danger was the sticker in the back of the guitar amp. The boys were from the wrong side of town and didn’t quite fit in with the ‘art school’ scene.The band carried on regardless, and somewhat helpless as something called punk, that housed everything they stood for died a slow dead in a city once internationally known for it’s punk/hardcore scene and fuck you-attitude. Sick of what was left of that scene they helped to build, the band regained their strength on the ashes and ruins that where left behind . Eager to bring back what was lost on the way.\n Bruised, broken, bitter, down but not out. These words define Landmine Heart through out the years. It formed and shaped a sound of bitterness with a little bit of hope. But…….if you step on it, it will explode!\n\n Director Name: Noortje Bakker\n Producer Name: Noortje Bakker\n\n About the Video: Official single video\n\n Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/landmineheartpunk\n BandCamp: https://landmineheart.bandcamp.com\n Instagram: landmineheart\n\n Label Name: Aggrobeat Records\n Label Website: www.aggrobeat.com\n\n Song Lyrics: \"No Direction Home\"\n\nIt`s been a while since my high dropped to a low.\nThe fucked up part is that it`s starting to show.\nFall down on my knees as I say my prayers.\nBut there is no forgiveness for me or for the things I did.\n\nI`ve been here for far too long \nI`ve got a heart without a home\n\nNot that i`m lost here but I can`t find my way\nI`m growing older but not wiser by day\nHome is where the heart is, that’s where I want to be\nBut I keep drifting further away, is there a place for me\n\nI`ve got a heart\nWithout a home\nGot a heart without a home\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FRVP6Y8Xgqs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FRVP6Y8Xgqs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FRVP6Y8Xgqs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FRVP6Y8Xgqs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FRVP6Y8Xgqs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":662,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FRVP6Y8Xgqs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/kl8v4nAR_6s3QhJZWTjVI6ZLLdU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmxyQUNOLURBWUVv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-25T03:55:38.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Gabriel and the Apocalypse - \"March of the Dolls\" Pavement Entertainment","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Gabriel and the Apocalypse - \"March of the Dolls\" - Like this video?

The band delivers a fierce yet beautiful array of female fronted aggression that will give their predecessors a run for their money.\nThe brainchild of vocalist Lindy Gabriel, Gabriel and the Apocalypse put out two independent releases which were backed by numerous national support tours around the United States. Their intense and and professional style videos also paved the way for the group to become an underground sensation. \nIt was this self produced success that led GATA to ink a deal with Pavement Entertainment to which they immediately began work on their new album 'The Ghost Parade'. This new release (available October 7, 2016) is sure to propel the band to new heights with major worldwide distribution and exposure. To kick off the album's release, GATA toured with horror rock favorite Wednesday 13 throughout the month of October with heavy and extensive touring cycle that followed.\nAccording to Lindy, 'The Ghost Parade' is a concept record that brings you on a music roller coaster ride. From in your face songs like \"March of the Dolls\" to stripped down emotional songs like \"Behind the Sun\", this record still maintains a taste of the usual GATA anthems on politics and world issues but as a whole it is more personal.  I feel as a writer and lyricist it is more abstract & poetic. I feel more exposed and vulnerable. It's honest. It flows and twists through different waves and moods from beginning to end.\n\nCreative, Original, Visual, Artistic, Strong……the definition of GABRIEL AND THE APOCALYPSE\n\nDirector Name:  Cody Evan Hoffman\nProducer Name:  Cody Evan Hoffman\n\nArtist Website:  https://www.gabrielandtheapocalypse.com\nFacebook:  http://www.facebook.com/gabrielandtheapocalypse\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/GATA_band\n\nLabel Name:  Pavement Entertainment\nLabel Website: https://www.pavementmusic.com/\n\nSong Lyrics:  \"March of the Dolls\"\n\nYou want, you need, you're begging to please, get on your knees, I'll make you believe.\nI want, I need, I love the taste, my sweat is smeared across your face.\nMy God, your God, it's all the same, Another sin for another savor.

In the current climate, New York's Husbandry are a genuine oddity. They're a heavy, progressive-without-being-prog rock band with a real-deal singer, who aren't afraid to write actual songs and play them with unabashed flair and enthusiasm. In other words, they evoke that magical early-to-mid-'90s moment when great, unclassifiable bands like Quicksand, Jawbox and Shudder to Think flourished, while avoiding tired retro tendencies. Unlike so many heavy bands these days, they truly seem to want you to listen and remember what you hear.\n\nHUSBANDRY:\nCarina Zachary - Vocals\nJordan Usatch - Guitars, bass\nArnau Bosc - Bass, vocals, bass, percussion\nAndrew Gottlieb - Drums\n\nDirector Name: Eric Palmerlee & Johnathan Swafford\nProducer Name: Aqualamb\n\nAbout the Video: “Lyrically, this song is coming from an observational standpoint. I was exposed to different religions throughout my childhood, by way of my family's interests and my own existentialism. It's always fascinated me how faith and religious beliefs can be such a powerful force in people's lives. One of my last experiences involved the Mormon church, when I was in my teens.\nAlmost every line in this song pertains to things I directly observed or experienced. For example,the first line “Come 'fore the great sun (son) rises…” connects to the youth of the church (myself included), having to get up early (before the sun even rose) to attend religious morning classes daily, before heading to actual school.\nPersonally, I found the religion full of plot holes and focused on self restraint, though many twisted things were happening amongst the people of the community itself. It’s a song about delusion and the hypocrisy of religion. It wasn't a sustainable way of life for me. But I don't look back on that time with resentment or knock anyone who finds comfort in its teachings.”\n\n\nArtist Website: http://www.husbandry.nyc/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/husbandrynyc\nTwitter: @husbandrynyc\nBandCamp: https://husbandryny.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/husbandrynyc/\n\nLabel Name: Aqualamb Records\nLabel Website: http://www.aqualamb.org\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Elder Spencer Deery\"\n\nCome ‘fore the great sun rises.\nGuide me, through and through.\nDressed in holy undergarments.\nWatchful eyes, they say:\n“Let the word remake you”\n“Bow before those sent”\nYoung missionaries, eyes half-closed, twist fable into proof.\nIncendiary lust for what will lead to certain doom.\nCall out, call out, to make us... To make us...\nConstricted, sinless, vacant.\nI will not cave in.\nThe lines between have been read.\nRipped off the verses from my skin.\nProphetic gift, sever the limb.\nYoung missionaries, eyes half-closed, twist fable into proof.\nIncendiary lust for what will lead to certain doom.\nCall out, call out, to make us...

Christ across your mouth.\nWatchful eyes, they say:\n“Let the word remake you”\nWe were one, built to break down.\nTo fall apart.\nDidn’t know learning to doubt would be the start...

Illumino - Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: Pietermaritzburg, South Africa\n\nArtist Biography: SK SUPREME hails from Pietermaritzburg South Africa.This musical journey started off in 2008 when SK started rapping, as a hobby, and has gone through through many different genres and inspirations which have resulted in his evolution as a producer, rapper, vocalist and songwriter.\nToday SK is a skilled Rapper, Producer, Vocalist and engineers all of his own music, as well as some the work of artists he’s worked with.

From a purgatory stand point, a modern Pharaoh will lead a free spirited life, while being connected to his higher self and fulfilling his own destiny.\n\nArtist Website: http://chamberxi.tumblr.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/skxsupreme\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/skxsurpeme\nBandCamp: https://skxsupreme.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/skxsupreme\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/skxsupreme\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dht09fmHuT4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dht09fmHuT4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dht09fmHuT4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dht09fmHuT4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dht09fmHuT4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":667,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"dht09fmHuT4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/2ZB8Kitj1_JnJi2ebIDfzksWuZk\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlFzaEVsQkVaMTBz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-23T03:23:17.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Kolossor - \"Scourge\" Rev X Productions - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Kolossor - \"Scourge\" - Like this video?

Featuring former members of Philadelphia based sludge metal and doom acts such as: Swarm of Arrows, Wizard Eye, and Meatplow, Kolossor combines their collective musical experience to forge their own path within the genre of heavy music. \nKolossor finds its inspiration from many sources of music, classic horror movies, Japanese kaiju monsters, cold beer, and old school video game boss battles. Kolossor then combines these influences to create their own brand of heavy sludge filled riffage, aggro vocals, and pummeling rhythms.

The lore tells the story of the band's origins, battles of divine conquest and showcases their creativity and vision, which sets the stage for a very entertaining live performance where bigger is better, and Epic is always the standard.\nThe Summoners released their fist EP, entitled 'First Summoning', in late 2015. This was followed in 2016 by the single, \"Become None\", and its b-side, Minotaur, both of which will be included on the upcoming full-length release entitled 'Tome', which will be released later in 2017.\n\nDirector Name: Thomas Mortveit\nProducer Name: Yanic Bercier\n\nAbout the Video: SUMMONER’S CIRCLE, the epic metal band from the USA, releases their debut music video for the track \"Become None\", from the upcoming full-length album 'Tome'. This video, originating from the otherworldly denizens of Mercury, successfully captures the essence of the band’s theatrically inspired, occult-infused brand of heavy metal. Shrouded figures, hidden books of lore, ceremonial daggers, human sacrifice and rituals of transformation all accompany the eerily anthemic musical score.\nThe video was filmed and edited by Norwegian artist Thomas Mortveit, and the music was recorded and produced by Canadian engineer Yanic Bercier at WaveTransform Studios.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.summonerscircle.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/summonerscircle/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/summoners13\nBandCamp: https://summonerscircle.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/summonerscircle/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Become None\"\n\nWalk with us \nSweet acolyte \nIn shadows we find \nThe savage truth of light \nBecome None \n\nBeen told you are filth \nFor the faults of your forebear \nYou must redeem \nWe offer a simple truth \nWritten in blood magick \nShroud yourself \nDrink of ancient wisdom \nWalk beside us and scream \nEnter the circle \nCarve your own way \nLet this world hear you say \nBecome None \n\nHollow you will be \nVoid of all light \nImmortal unclean \nWalk with us \nSweet acolyte \nIn shadows we find \nThe savage truth of light \nBecome None \n\nArch, vile and damned \nSummon the souls of \nAll you vanquish \nFrom eaters of the dead \nTo sinister old gods \nTo enact your will \nStrength in self \nPower in numbers \nEnter the circle\nCarve your own way \nLet this world hear you say \nBecome None \n\nHollow you will be \nVoid of all light \nImmortal unclean \nWalk with us \nSweet acolyte \nIn shadows we find \nThe savage truth of light \nBecome None \n\nBare witness \nHerald our coming \nBe renamed in shadow \nGive up earthly doubt \nFor wonder found \nIn the blackest realms \nEmpty your soul \nAnd Become None\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DHkVCyQbtaw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DHkVCyQbtaw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DHkVCyQbtaw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DHkVCyQbtaw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DHkVCyQbtaw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":670,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"DHkVCyQbtaw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/DZyB_X12G37nWvsmoktcJZ8NL4E\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlJPcV9ucl9pU2VV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-21T22:45:17.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Stinky - \"Sliders\" Finisterian Dead End / Delete Your Favorite Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Stinky - \"Sliders\" - Like this video?

Kolossor then combines these influences to create their own brand of heavy sludge filled riffage, aggro vocals, and pummeling rhythms.

Ohio’s misfit son exposed to harsher California desert landscapes delivers on the long lost love letters you waited for at the mailbox all of those years.  Hoping for a promise of return, you receive word of yet another lonely voyage.  Are you remembered?\n\nIsolation waters the fertile land stretching out in all directions.  LaValley’s unapologetic crooning calls the banshees back from the frozen wilderness and welcomes them into his modest desert cabin.\n\nA small crew of creative visitors contribute to LaValley’s debut full length, From LaValley Below.  Harmonica, lap-steel, and female vocals move around acoustic guitar, all the while the crestfallen and introspective lyrics roll downstream like gravel under water, catching the light and sweeping the riverbank grasses along with it.  A kindred spirit with contemporary songwriters like Ryley Walker, LaValley also conjures images of a gothic Gene Clark collaborating with a desert-dwelling Bonnie “Prince” Billy---with the blessing of Townes Van Zandt.\n\nLaValley’s songs are infused with communalism and camaraderie.  However, the album’s creation was not without incident.  One day while recording, an unknown neighbor of LaValley’s in the Joshua Tree desert---apparently unnerved by the recording session going on up the hill from their fortified desert home---fired multiple rifle shots into the cabin where LaValley and company were working.  Thankfully no one was injured by the potent incursion, but perhaps the incident cast a shadow on the album’s recording.  Ultimately, 'From LaValley Below' proves that beauty is bulletproof.  We believe that Grant Earl LaValley’s debut full-length illustrates this maxim both literally and figuratively. \n\nDirector Name: Jonathan King\nProducer Name: Sarah Bernat\n\nAbout the Video:  “I loaded up my moto and went to meet a crew of friends out in Death Valley for the shoot. The footage was originally intended to be a teaser for a feature-length film that Jonathan King conceptualized. Things changed with the film and it ended up getting put on hold, but Jonathan felt the death valley shots were a perfect match for “The In-Betweens” song that I’d recorded with Martin Craft. The song being about schizophrenia and the extremely separate realities we all live in was perfectly complimented by the annual cloud covering of Death Valley, which had a wind that blew so hard it had me riding my bike sideways.” \n\nArtist Website: https://www.exitstencil.org/store/h5grant-earl-lavalleyh5h2from-lavalley-below\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/grant.lavalley\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GrantLavalley\nBandCamp: https://grantearllavalley.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gurle_lavalley/\n\nLabel Name: Exit Stencil Recordings\nLabel Website: http://www.exitstencil.org\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BKHxlQIEpwo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BKHxlQIEpwo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BKHxlQIEpwo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BKHxlQIEpwo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BKHxlQIEpwo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":676,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BKHxlQIEpwo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/nq2rZAY68LT0Oeg7gy-4NdFCJSw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjZzX181WDFSdzFB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-19T17:47:58.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Company Retreat - \"80's Babies\" Encapsulated Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Company Retreat - \"80's Babies\" - Like this video?

Featuring former members of Philadelphia based sludge metal and doom acts such as: Swarm of Arrows, Wizard Eye, and Meatplow, Kolossor combines their collective musical experience to forge their own path within the genre of heavy music. \nKolossor finds its inspiration from many sources of music, classic horror movies, Japanese kaiju monsters, cold beer, and old school video game boss battles. Kolossor then combines these influences to create their own brand of heavy sludge filled riffage, aggro vocals, and pummeling rhythms. Kolossor is here to use its un-earthly strength to destroy all that man has created.\n\nDirector Name: Jerry Arsenault\nProducer Name: Jerry Arsenault\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/kolossor/\nBandCamp: https://kolossor.bandcamp.com/releases\nSound Cloud: https://soundcloud.com/kolossor\nContact: kolossorband@gmail.com\n\nLabel Name: Rev X Productions\nLabel Website: https://revxproductions.weebly.com/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_JOdcnL9zI8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_JOdcnL9zI8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_JOdcnL9zI8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_JOdcnL9zI8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_JOdcnL9zI8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":678,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_JOdcnL9zI8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Lg_KiAQSxxGf_fOVD3EpqWBo8q0\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlpQc2FjanBJdlNz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-19T05:07:57.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Mountain Estates - \"Humans Are People Too!\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Mountain Estates - \"Humans Are People Too!\" - Like this video?

Sima - Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: Stockholm, Sweden\n\nArtist Biography: The Friday Prophets started out in 2010 with the intention of playing loud and catchy party punk rock in their hometown of Umeå, Sweden. Three years later they had self-released their debut album 'Bits & Pieces' which includes 31 minutes of short punk rock sing-along anthems. A while after this the band slowly started to move their way down to Stockholm and by the time My Storms to Conquer was released (2016) the band had split up geographically. Nevertheless, this Ep demonstrated that the band could write punk rock tracks with a deeper meaning. Today the band is based in Stockholm and has evolved their sound into a certain type of punk rock that adopts clean harmonies and deep lyricism; without losing too much of their energized and cheerful vibe.\n\nDirector Name: The band\nProducer Name: The band\n\nAbout the Video: Tour video, clips from the road and live gigs.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.thefridayprophets.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFridayProphets/\nBandCamp: https://thefridayprophets.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: @thefridayprophets\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Metaperceptive Overload\"\n\nBlowing things out of proportion\nI’m choking on these metaperceptions\nI try to penetrate their heads, transcribe their brains\nThese guessing games tend to lead me\nRight out in the middle of fucking nowhere\nWhat I think you think about me I think says more about me\nI’m stuck so far in my own head\nDissecting every move\nLike a neurosurgeon operating on her own mind\nYes, I’m the creep standing in the corner\nStaring at the floor\nLooking for words, words a normal person would use\nIn the game of picking up social cues\nI’m a pickup artist fucking everything that moves\nI can’t stop it what the fuck is wrong with me? (Doctor!)\nLobotomize my right temporoparietal junction\nCause it’s overheating and it makes me malfunction\nThey say ignorance is bliss and I would like a piece of it\n(Yes, I would like one ignorance please.)\nWhat am I sayin’? What am I doing?\nAm I standing weird? Should I switch position?\nParanoid, I’m paranoid\nDid they just laugh with me or at me?\nSome have a train of thought I’ve a thousand of them\nLocomotives running around in my head and\nCausing traffic jams stopping everything\nI tried to tell a story but then it all went black\nMy short term memory bailed and I forgot what to say\nSo let’s skip the punchline and jump right to the end\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhfwKscUCHg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhfwKscUCHg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhfwKscUCHg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhfwKscUCHg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhfwKscUCHg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":681,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FhfwKscUCHg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/fGuVDBFFWD3G0r7kfS7IAskTius\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkdiWDBubmV0WGxj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-19T17:34:28.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Diavol - \"Let Me Be\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Diavol - \"Let Me Be\" - Like this video?

After learning the ropes playing in various cover bands, the guys decide to join forces to build up their own heavy/thrash metal band. No Way Out begins composing songs whose sound goes from traditional heavy metal to thrash, including additional elements that come from the musical background of the band members. The result is an original style which perfectly mixes aggressiveness and melody. After months of hard work in search of a personal and unique style, the band is ready to compose the first set of songs. In late 2016 the five guys enter the Art Distillery Studios in Modena to record their first EP 'Dirty Games', which sees the light at the beginning of 2017. The release is followed by a list of concerts as supporting band to promote the disc. Nevertheless, the band does not want to rest a minute and continues composing new songs. Just a few months after the release of the EP, No Way Out is back in the studio to record the first set of songs for the upcoming first full-length.\n\nDirector Name: No Way Out\nProducer Name: No Way Out\n\nAbout the Video: If you love Breaking Bad you have to listen this song!\n\nArtist Website: http://nowayout-mb.com/#about\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NoWayOut.mb/\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/nowayout5\nBandCamp: https://nowayout-mb.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nowayout.mb/?hl=it\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4CvDIg3rcgQ3IX94WZuoSM\n\nSong Lyrics: \"99.1%\"\n\nI love my family, as well as chemistry\nThe city is at my feet, I rule the streets\nA cancer brought me here, erased my fear\nDown in my lab I cook\nmy pure blue sky\nI'm Heisenberg\nyou're goddamn right\nNow say my name, bitch,\nhere I am the boss\nDo you know who you're talking to? \nI am the one who knocks\nEveryone's after me, in the DEA\nto rage I ain't no stranger, I am the danger\nMy back’s against the wall\nBetter call Saul\nDown in my lab I cook\nand here I hide\nI’m Heisenberg\nor Walter White?\nNow say my name, bitch,\nhere I am the boss\nDo you know who you're talking to? \nI am the one who knocks\nNow say my name, bitch,\nhere I am the boss\nDo you know who you're talking to? \nI am the one who knocks\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xf2ORqehoY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xf2ORqehoY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xf2ORqehoY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xf2ORqehoY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xf2ORqehoY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":698,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"5xf2ORqehoY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/XDXFi1JJct7QzK3kXMpLd-Yqg-E\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlpTODdqSzdxb3Vz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-13T08:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Kinjiru - \"Never Ever\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Kinjiru - \"Never Ever\" - Like this video?

It’s a departure from the videos Volpe has released so far, which include the title track’s video, where Volpe dons a Yeti suit; “The Road,” starring the seductive disco moves of drag queen Dusty Ray Bottoms; and “When I’m Gone,” filmed on the streets of Brooklyn.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.ginavolpe.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ginavolpeco/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ginavolpeco\nBandCamp: https://ginavolpe.bandcamp.com/album/different-animal\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ginavolpeco/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Bantam\n\nLabel Name: Heavy Nose Records\nLabel Website: http://www.ginavolpe.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Shine\" \n\nAnd\nI can feel you still\nEcho of a world\nThat once existed / And fell back into \n \nEarth\nHanging in the air\nDark Carbon chain\nswimming in the sunlight/ I’m seeing you \n \nAgain\nA waking dream\nStanding there alone \nTo be remembered / I will set you aglow  \n \nand see you rise\nCome Crystallized\ntaken from the mine \n \nI will see you \nYou are not forgotten over time    \nHold what you left behind\nI will see I will see you shine\n \nnow\nthe wick is lit\nIt’s what you asked\nAll you ever wanted/ to not fall into the\n \nPast\nLingers and (then) it fades\nA Trace of time\nIn waves you travel/in and out like\n \nBreath\nBut a different kind\nchanging form    shedding skin       a new life born   \n \nBorn And set alight\nCome crystallized\nfrom the other side\n \nyou are not forgotten over time \nIn the red house by the woods\nI will see I will see you Shine\n\n© Gina Volpe 2017\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAzJ3GBqv7A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAzJ3GBqv7A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAzJ3GBqv7A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":700,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HAzJ3GBqv7A"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/H4LiU8AHm5pKOyLCcyNqSt0PMeU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LldzSHRteW5jdl84","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-15T01:50:29.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Figure of Six - \"Clown\" Bleeding Nose Records - Official Music Video - NSFW","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Figure of Six - \"Clown\" - Like this video?

Sights in the eyes of another fallacy. Squandering every effort than I’ve done to keep everything to be fine; For one self to be sublime. Hope for a light of an escape, it seems like I’m vanishing with a saddening pace. Oh, how I’ve carried myself through, imminently I stand to be complied by danger. Every step has been taken but I’m blessed with indignation! And I’m sure that I can carry myself to keep everything, I mean everything to be fine for you!” “The potential I had, the belief that I had, wondering how everything can be so disconcerting. I’m losing every optimism of the outcome of what might be something special in the remainder of my life. Scampered out of fear, I’m left all unassured. Sights in the eyes of another fallacy!” Little did we know! Oh, little did we know that people would take us for what we hate and not for what we cherish to be!\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkZVmF5Q_rQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkZVmF5Q_rQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkZVmF5Q_rQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkZVmF5Q_rQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkZVmF5Q_rQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":702,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"VkZVmF5Q_rQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/D_mWrjIyNNeBed_3fX7WHlajMNE\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmNIcDJHWERhRnZ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-14T21:53:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Stay Out - \"All We Know\" East Bay Prodigies - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Stay Out - \"All We Know\" - Like this video?

George Holman, who records under the moniker Peacock Affect, is an exception to that rule - not only is the Exeter, UK-based musician his own harshest critic—he’s discerning about which songs see the light of day. In Holman’s hands, his influences feel new, thanks to impeccable, spacious arrangements that give the music room to breathe. Holman is a versatile vocalist with expressive range; he’ll switch from keening falsetto to a low-register growl, sometimes in the same song. Peacock Affect’s music is successful because of its purity and lack of artifice, Holman isn’t afraid to make himself vulnerable, but he does so with purpose and clarity. “Usually, I have piles of lyrics next to my bed and poems I write on my phone—just random lines and stuff,” he says. “I just enjoy writing songs when I feel like it, when the moment takes me,” he continues. “It’s important that I write a song when I feel like writing a song, not when I have to or need to. It’s definitely the way forward—for me, anyway. I’ve heard Eminem apparently goes in the studio, and they just work at it. He writes great stuff, but that’s just not the way I work. I just do it when I feel like it. I feel that’s the way most art should be made.”—Annie Zaleski \n\nDirector Name: Joe Baughman\nProducer Name: George Holman\n\nArtist Website: http://www.peacockaffect.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/peacockaffect\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/peacockaffect\nBandCamp: https://peacockaffectmusic.bandcamp.com/track/straight-into-the-rails\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/peacockaffect\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/peacockaffect\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/peacockaffect\nContact: peacockaffect@gmail.com\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Straight into the Rails\"\n\nWhen everything I've been worrying about finally kills me \nI'll let it kill me \nGhosts even ghosts die \nSomehow \nBlack colors and red rain tears \nBecause you only lose what you cling to \nThe trees and wind are dead \nThe sea and everything else \nI walk imperfectly \nStraight into the rails \nStraight into the rails \nThe trees and wind are dead \nThe sea and everything else \n \nWell I've healed the blind and raised the dead\nI can't seem to feel the pain anymore \nI'll cut this cut and waste away \nBecause I can't seem to sleep anymore \nStraight into the rails \nStraight into the rails \n \n(I can't feel it anymore, anymore) \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/exfm0puyLKU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/exfm0puyLKU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/exfm0puyLKU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/exfm0puyLKU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/exfm0puyLKU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":709,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"exfm0puyLKU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/tfdJT3uyFDVBUY8RLWp1E4S2-8M\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmNMOWxWRVJWamtv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-14T03:04:57.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Black Knives - \"You're Not So Special\" Send the Wood Music","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Black Knives - \"You're Not So Special\" - Like this video?

I have been living your lie for too long. floating between ignorance and denial. but you don’t know me, you don’t own me. I have been dreaming of a better life now. I have seen these changes in the clouds, the presence of these darkened skies. following your directives changing my perspectives. I see through your empty lies now. right now. I can see through your empty lies now.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbPX2b2u9Aw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbPX2b2u9Aw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbPX2b2u9Aw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbPX2b2u9Aw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbPX2b2u9Aw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":711,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NbPX2b2u9Aw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/e25PY-WKv3mlPHvIYFJ6fKQTeVQ\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlNfMUkwSGVTUWV3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-07T06:54:13.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Kann Tod Frieden Bringen - \"Fühl Dich Frei\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Kann Tod Frieden Bringen - \"Fühl Dich Frei\" - Like this video?

YOU TREATED ME JUST LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH…BUT BABY, YOU STOLE MY LOVE. YOU STOLE MY LOVE. I thought it might be fun to go for somebody young, but you took everything, even the air in my lungs. You could never rest and you’re never pleased, that’s why I decided to leave! CHORUS\nI’ll make you happy, I can make you well, I’ll give you light. Don’t make me your everything, the only good in your life. I’ll be your precious stone, I’ll be your treasure, but it won’t make me brilliant I’ll just crumble under the pressure!

Champagne, unlike the bands prestigious namesake, weave together a brand of uptown pop rock, cleverly engineered to be enjoyed en masse.\n\nThe band hail from The Midlands and South coast areas of England, forming due to the collapse of previous projects and a new-found penchant to explore a more radio friendly sound. Their debut EP ‘Late Night Television’ is due to be released in late 2017 and promises to be one not to be missed. Expect to be humming the catchy vocal lines and tapping your feet to the infectious drum beats. Tracks from the EP have already seen early support from the likes of The BBC.\n\nChampagne’s sonic inspiration is drawn from a blend of British rock music and the monstrous hook stylings of the top 40 chart, wrapped up with a pinch of classic eighties neon drenched synth to keep it all cohesively in check.\n\nA strong DIY work ethic and radio friendly sound, coupled with experience and drive promises to see Champagne climb the ladder in a crowded market. This is just the beginning.\n\nChampagne are Jake Clark, Freddie Goli, Joe Newman and Pash Stratton.\n\nDirector Name: Champagne\nProducer Name: Freddie Goli, Pash Stratton\n\nArtist Website: http://wearechampagne.co.uk\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/wearechampagne\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/weare_champagne\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/weare_champagne\n\nLabel Name: Horus Music\nLabel Website: https://www.horusmusic.global/\n\nSong Lyrics:\n\nNot a stranger to love\nWhat have we become\nYour side of the bed's cold \nAnd I'm all alone\nPlease pick up the phone \nAnd just let me know\nCause I don't\n\nOne foot in front of the other\nOutside a club \nGotta get it together\nBounce won't let me in\nSaid I'm ready for bed\nAnd there ain't no way I'm getting past him\nI'm past it\nI've got a few drinks left in me\nSo I head to another club \nWhere the girls are more friendly\nI'm not here to play\nBut I can't sleep alone\n\nChange your clothes\nFix your hair\nPut your makeup on\nYou got me feeling right\nAin't holding tight\nLet's Go Out Tonight\nPicking fights\nTelling lies\nIt's the same old night\nBut it's all alright\nCause we're too high\nLet's Go Out Tonight\n\nWhere's my keys I've lost my phone\nThe morning after\nI really should ask her\nIf she needs a ride home\nBut instead we stay in bed\nShe's still looking pretty fit\nWell I'm impressed\nWhen she started rolling over\nI said \"Can I get your number\"\nMaybe do this again at your place\n\nTime fly's drinking cheap wine\nSitting on my sofa\nChatting shit until the sunrise\nYou drink your rum and pepsi cola\nI feel like I already know you\nBut it's not gonna work out this time\nSo Let's go out tonight\n\nChange your clothes\nFix your hair\nPut your makeup on\nYou got me feeling right\nAin't holding tight\nLet's Go Out Tonight\nPicking fights\nTelling lies\nIt's the same old night\nBut it's all alright\nCause we're too high\nLet's Go Out Tonight\n\nI can see your body\nMaking shapes in the light\nLet me hold you baby\nLet's do this right\nI can see your body\nMaking shapes in the light\nLet me hold you baby\nLet's do this right\n\nChange your clothes\nFix your hair\nPut your makeup on\nYou got me feeling right\nAin't holding tight\nLet's Go Out Tonight\nPicking fights\nTelling lies\nIt's the same old night\nBut it's all alright\nCause we're too high\nLet's Go Out Tonight\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vC9O_45NGoA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vC9O_45NGoA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vC9O_45NGoA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vC9O_45NGoA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vC9O_45NGoA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":717,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"vC9O_45NGoA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/FygIvPsH4ERWD4DKV7pFheKb3ug\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnVvZHpRYkdBSEh3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-13T18:15:29.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Supernothing - \"Smooth Operator\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Supernothing - \"Smooth Operator\" - Like this video?

Traverse the Abyss formed in mid 2016 and current line up is Eric Abyss (Vocals), \"Iron\" Mike White (Guitar), Mike \"Bnoc\" Bieniecki (Bass/Backing Vocals), Seth Cardona (Guitar) & Nathan Cardona (Drums).\nTraverse the Abyss debuted onto the music scene on October 1st, 2016 with the lyric video for the single \"One of a Kind\" a modern metal song with positive self empowering lyrics and a consistent thundering drive throughout the song. On November 26th, 2016, Traverse the Abyss released their debut album 'The Gamble of Life', 'The Gamble of Life' represents everyday life scenarios and/or feelings and meshes it with gambling terms to reflect on how life is a gamble, you never know what to expect or if the odds are in your favor. Traverse the Abyss took a \"gamble\" when writing 'The Gamble of Life' by uniquely incorporating sub genres all over the Metal spectrum and venturing off into the regions of Pop Punk, Punk Rock, Hard Rock, Rap and more.\nAttention quickly came in the band's direction as a \"breath of fresh air\" in the Metal genre and even in the music industry. Traverse the Abyss became an endorsed artist of Dirtbag Clothing ( Halestorm, Black Stone Cherry, Don Jamieson) shortly after the release of The Gamble of Life and released the lyric video for \"Royal Flush\" made by Dirtbag Clothing.\n\nDirector Name:  Michael Belardi\nProducer Name: Michael Belardi\n\nAbout the Video: Black & White, Band Playing\n\nFacebook:  http://www.facebook.com/traversetheabyss \nTwitter:  http://www.twitter.com/traversetabyss \nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/traversetheabyss \nBandCamp:  http://traversetheabyss.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/traversetheabyssofficial\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Dead Weight\"\n\nCut the dead weight \nNothing changed you're still the same \nForget my face, remember my name \nThink back to the days when you let me down like my time is something to waste \nHere we go I'll call you out you're a fucking disgrace \nThe empty promises you never kept \nI hope they plague your mind and make you sick \nLike they make me, you're now my enemy perhaps you should \nThink back to the days where you let me down like my time is something to waste \nHere we go I'll call you out, you're a fucking disgrace \nForget my face, remember my name \nBridges you burned now lay in waste \nForget my face, remember my name \nNow I move on with the memories erased \nYou're fucking dead to me \nI think you've mistaken me for someone who truly gives a fuck, \nI'll spit in your face when you are down on your knees tough shit you fucked up \nForget my face, remember my name \nDead Weight\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H6F3p8z4g7E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H6F3p8z4g7E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H6F3p8z4g7E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H6F3p8z4g7E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H6F3p8z4g7E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":729,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"H6F3p8z4g7E"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/XRxNHi1Vc5qxgHAgHql-BxQUbtQ\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjEyc05aSm9FOXhn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-12T05:43:12.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Anastasia Minster - \"Hour of the Wolf\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Anastasia Minster - \"Hour of the Wolf\" - Like this video?

Such is the case with Moscow-born artist Anastasia Minster. Having captivated audiences for several years, Anastasia left her homeland for Toronto in 2014 and it’s now apparent just how deeply Russia has seeped into her soul.  It can be seen in her dark and existential lyrics (think Dostoevsky) and heard in the Rachmaninoff-like intensity that pours out of her own music - piano-driven chamber pop which fuses elements of classical, folk and jazz.\n  Just as Anastasia’s past shapes her sound, so does her new home in Canada. Living in a building overlooking a colossal park, her piano sits beside the window so that she can watch the sunset. It’s where she observes hawks as they soar, listens to coyotes howl and wakes up to the dawn chorus at 5 am. This is her favourite time of day, when there are no other sounds to hide their singing.\n  As the birds welcome the day, Anastasia’s is music to break the silence of the dark and to accompany those witching-hour questions of life and death, estrangement and connection. It should come as no surprise that composing is her form of meditation, a vessel for her unconscious mind.\n  Once the skeleton of a song is there it’s up to her band members to add their parts. Their task is to add to the voice and piano that she has left for them, without breaking the fragile space that has been created. It’s all there to be heard on her new album Hour of the Wolf, the most expansive recording of her career to date, on which she has invited upright bass, cello, saxophone, bass clarinet and more to enter her world.\n   At the centre of the new album is the title track. Inspired by Ingmar Bergman’s film of the same name and Carl Jung’s concept of “shadow self”, it looks at the destructive forces within the human psyche.  Each song on the record represents a different state of mind, from feeling trapped in one’s own body to accepting the inevitability of death. Listeners will hear a dark mellowness close to Nina Simone’s and the supple dexterity of David Sylvian. Whatever its origins, this is music that echoes life itself - no matter how far the darkness creeps there’s always a flicker of light.\n\nDirector Name: Anastasia Minster\nProducer Name: Anastasia Minster\n\nArtist Website: http://www.anastasiaminster.ca/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/anastasiaminster/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ana_minster\nBandCamp: https://anastasiaminster.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/anastasia_minster/\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Hour of the Wolf\" \n\nClaws \nTight around my neck\nDon't \nLet go too soon\nI \nWill be bone of your bones\nFlesh of your flesh\nApple of your eye\n\nHere\nAnd forever after\nHere\nWhere no one can see\nWe'll cling\nTill the end of time\nMy shadow to yours\nYour shadow to mine\n\nShadows\nWe grow\nShadows\nWe go\nLie down\nOn the blades of the grass\nLook at the furry stars\nDown \nBy the roots\nHushed\nBy the howling woods\nScars over scars\nOh what a mess we are\n\nA flash in his eye\nA splash on my wrist\nI'm a cloud\nI'm a firefly\nI am floating above the trees\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12sNZJoE9xg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12sNZJoE9xg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12sNZJoE9xg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12sNZJoE9xg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12sNZJoE9xg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":730,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"12sNZJoE9xg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/BWtf_xegFVoh0l5nkA2xvnPhx3Y\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnJoTXl0b2NZVHYw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-11T09:17:48.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Black Orchestra - \"Resurrection\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Black Orchestra - \"Resurrection\" - Like this video?

But also in love with the Hip Hop movement. Guys wanted to bring something new to Europe, a mix of groove, power and clever lyrics, committed against the new world order propaganda, denunciation of N.A.T.O. crimes and U.N lies. We strive to be pointing the finger at the paradox that concerns the western countries who wrote the declaration of the human rights and all the criminal actions that the same nations are committing for decades over OUR planet.\nThe band has also had a real commitment to homeless people in Paris for years and takes inspiration from this action to share our experience. \n Honesty has taken part in lot of human projects, shows for ill-children, compilation for children in need, compilation for people of Syria, association to the HHF (Hardcore Help Foundation) : presence at the benefit show, on the first compilation and Asian tour with funds collected for the victims of the flooding in the Philippines.\nIn eight years, there were two demos and three albums released :  'Back to Reality' (Disagree Records – 2007), \n'We Got Game' (Goodlife Records – 2009) and  'The American Dream' (Core-Tex Records – 2012) feat. Barcode and Ray Skarhead.\nThe band has played more than 200 shows all over the globe with Madball, Agnostic Front, Down, Lagwagon and many more; made several European tours with Backfire ! (Netherlands), Billy Club Sandwich (USA), The Boss (Belgium) and an Asian tour in 2012 with the OVC Family.\nAs long as the world will spill the blood of the innocents, Honesty will rise against.\" \n\nDirector Name: HONESTY \nProducer Name: HONESTY \n\nAbout the Video: HONESTY \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/honestyhardcore\nBandCamp: https://honestyhxc.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: honesty_hxc_official \n\nLabel Name: M&O Music\nLabel Website: http://www.m-o-music.com/\n\nSong Lyrics:\nEyes up to the sky ain't no gifts we sendin' to we bring no justice we drop bombs instead for We fuck your wife, we screw your world, We kill, we rape, we kill you all Time for holocaust, NATO criminal Nato crimes !

Each played guitar, with Moses taking the lead vocal role as well. This incarnation jammed garages and practice spaces for a year and a half before finally settling on a bassist and drummer, playing their first show in July of 2011.\n\nThe years that followed featured a revolving door of musicians and dozens of local shows. Blank Side has released four EP's since 2012, the last two releases consisting of their current members. \n In recent years, the band has traveled to play various south Texas cities, as well as opening locally for bands like The Queers and The Freeze.\nThe band’s sound started off as if conflicted, split down the middle between straight forward hardcore punk reminiscent of earl 80's acts like Germs or Jerry's Kids, with the other half of their tunes clearly influenced by the more melodic 90's wave of pop punk. By the time the 'Etheric' EP was released, they had taken a turn in the direction of powerviolence, now including more blast beats and breakdowns in their musical toolbox. With their latest singles, including \"Ringworm\", the band aspires to combine both, their brutal and melodic sides, often taking the listener on a journey across nearly their entire spectrum of influences in under three minutes.\n\nDirector Name: Angelo Lombana\nProducer Name: D'ante Speed of Machspeed Productions & Videography (@machspeed365)\n\nAbout the Video: This video is comprised of live footage. The footage was shot outside at an intersection of the St. Mary's strip during our 2017 SA Music Showcase performance. Our bassist edited the video lightly, and replaced the live audio with our studio track.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/blankside.blankside\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/3Blank1Side3/\nTwitter: @slankbide\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/blankside210\nBandCamp: http://www.blankside.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: @slankbide\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Ringworm\"\n\nTo throw the towel, or throw hands \nPicking the former, there's no chance \nThe bottom's rocky, it's the last round \nI was so cocky, now I'm crashed out \n\nI may as well quit with all this pressure \nThings don't get better, so it's whatever \nSwinging haymaykers, I'm no Mayweather \nBut I promise this - I won't say never \n\nOn the scorecards I'm down, down \nI'm gonna need a knock out \n\nI'm on my last leg, I'm on my own \n\nReady, Aim \nAim, Fire \n\nHere I am making hay \nLast round champ with the I can't take it face\n\nOther Videos: Blank Side - \"Fire\" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6gpT3e81Q4\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G-t9bCbPwJ0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G-t9bCbPwJ0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G-t9bCbPwJ0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G-t9bCbPwJ0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G-t9bCbPwJ0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":738,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"G-t9bCbPwJ0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/NvfVxa-9lAUyvwsMlvhrqriPNgQ\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmVyV0tsNVltTk9j","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-08T04:35:16.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Dissociates - \"Useless Wooden Toys\" Safety Second Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Dissociates - \"Useless Wooden Toys\" - Like this video?

After a short time Riccardo Rix Rigo joins the band as bassist and, in 2015, he is replaced by Maci Piovesan. The first live begin in January of 2014: from this date they produced two EPs, 'Rudhen' in 2014 and 'Imago Octopus' in 2015, four videoclips: “Hellraiser”, “Black Spirit”, “My Soul on Fire” and “Arabian Drag” and many dates in the north of Europe (Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Denmark) and in the north and middle of Italy. After the second EP Alessandro stopped playing guitar to focus on singing. \nIn 2017, Davide Lucato joined the band as bassist, and with him Rudhen recorded the first complete album: 'DI(O)SCURO', accompanied by the videoclip of single “Magnetic Hole”. \nEvocative and visionary lyrics and a mellow and hypnotic sound which have gone, in the last period, to the doom, with various psychedelic inserts. If the first works were markedly rock, 'DI(O)SCURO' represents an evolution to smoky and obsessive atmospheres who remember the Sleep, without forgetting the lesson of the fathers of the genre: Black Sabbath, all supported by elements of individual creativity of the components.\n\nDirector Name: LUCA DE GASPARI\nProducer Name:  Studio Tales\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RudhenBand/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Rudhen_Band\nBandCamp: https://rudhen.bandcamp.com/\n\nLabel Name: Leggend Records\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Magnetic Hole\"\n\nMAGNETIC HOLE HI GIRL, I’M YOUR SUN REALLY???

Emerged from the \"Post-punk\" scene, evolving with the passing of the years and creating a characteristic sound combining MIDI guitar synthesizers with rock guitar riffs. \nAfter several changes in its formation, it finally solidified with vocalist guitarist Diego \"Noctis\", guitarist Alvaro \"Pollo\", bassist Guillermo \"Khein\" and drummer Daniel \"García\".\nIn 2008 they released their debut album titled \"Alae Noctis\", a varied and experimental album which shows the influences of techno music from the eighties with songs like \"Shockwave\", Electro-new age music with \"Dark Crystal Dreams\" and After-punk with \"Fiesta en el Cementerio\". That year drummer and founding member Daniel “García\" leaves the formation, forcing the band to use drum machines for the recording in 2009 of the next album 'Cyborgs', less varied than its predecessor and showing a more industrial sound. Then guitarist Sergio \"Strike\" joins the band to replace Guillermo \"Khein\" with the bass and rhythm guitars, along with Dani \"Loco\" on drums.\nIn late 2013, they finished recording the album 'Rising from the Grave', inspired by horror films of the 80´s, and offering a retro, vintage and experimental sound.\n\nDirector Name: Fran Hernandez\nProducer Name:  Alae Noctis\n\nAbout the Video: \"Murder One\" (song from the album 'Slasher' 2016) \n\nArtist Website: http://alaenoctis.com \nFacebook: https://es-es.facebook.com/Alae-Noctis-226528870877953/ \n \nAlae Noctis - Inicio | Facebook\nes-es.facebook.com\nAlae Noctis. 900 Me gusta.

We started this project nearly three years ago now, and have put out two full length albums and an EP. Everything we do is 100% DIY because professional production costs are obnoxious. So, why not just do it ourselves? Also, we’re huge supporters of the LGBTQ community.\n\nDirector Name: Rob Billheimer\nProducer Name: Rob Billheimer\n\nAbout The Video: Pretty basic, this video and song is meant to be an anthem for people who just feel stuck in life.

(x2) \nJust pain!\n\nI won’t let them standing\nI won’t stop until reach the end \nI won’t yield to any obstacle \nOnly death will can beat me.

She decided that the best way to learn was on the job, performing more than forty gigs in 2014 alone. \nSelki began as a soloist on instrument and vocals, and later included other instrumentalists. Following an east coast tour with gigs in Brisbane, Cairns, Byron and Sydney, Selki returned to Melbourne in August of that same year, to become a four piece indie folk rock band.\nIn mid- 2015 Shanti relocated to Europe for 6 months,  whereupon Selki was again a solo Project but of the Indie- pop-rock variety. \n\nFollowing a vehicular accident in Paris and left with broken bones, Shanti was unable to play guitar  and SELKI was reinspired through collaboration with Paris based Producer: Loici Devehat from Soyou Studios. The product was three alt electronic pop tracks. Written and recorded in the few weeks before leaving France, Selki then returned to Melbourne in 2016.  Later in the year, further collaborations with electronic artist, looper and producer Trickbox produced dynamic direction for the Selki sound: playing such festivals as Rainbow Serpent Festival, Tanglewood, The Town, World Beyond and Stacks on Festival. \nIn the same Year she wrote an album with Electronic 80’s Duo Hype ( Unreleased), and was one of the first members of Melbourne Freshest new girl band: Tom Girl (Officially starting March 2017). Inspired to release the Paris Single, Selki released all three tracks under the single title: Skins.  This was marketed through a campaign in collaboration with Songwriters of Melbourne.   It saw her feature in Beat and Happy Magazine, with articles in Local Newspapers, appearance on Channel 9 television, along with Interviews and features on over 8 radio stations in that first week, with Danny Ross and the Cat Empire Backline supporting her single release at The Workers Club in April. In the same week leading up to the release, Selki saw an opportunity for a film clip when friend, model and videographer Carla Venus came to Melbourne for the Single launch.  Selki’s work with Carla and Fitzroy Based Melbourne Photographer and Videographer Rhys Newling, had the trio hustle a Black Magic cinema camera from a mate and the next day rock up at the convent with a hundred balloons, a bunch of outfits, glitter bubbles and only 3 hours to pull it all together.\n\n\nDirector Name:  Rhys Newling and  Carla Bel\nProducer Name: Rhys Newling\n\nAbout the Video: Selki's new clip Skins is fun, fresh and filled with colour moves and style.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.selkimusic.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/selkimusic\nBandCamp:  https://selkimusic.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: selkimoon\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Skins\"\n\nHo ho little child where do you run to tell me where you go\nHo ho little child where do you run to tell me where you go\nInside you mind lies a darker place, from where you spend so much time trying to escape.\n\nHo ho little child where do you run to tell me why you cry\nho ho little child, don't fear now there is so much time\nwe are made of skins and bones and not stones and sticks\nthat means when we break we're easier to fix.\n\nChorus\n\nwe are made of skins and bones\nwe are made of skins and bones\nwe are made of skins and bones\nso when we break we can reform\n\n\nHo ho little child I've watched you grow from a little seed\nho ho little child I've felt your fears your sorrows and your needs\nbut know one day you will triumph it all\nyou'll come out of your cave\nstanding strong and tall.\n\nchorus\nwe are made of skins and bones\nwe are made of skins and bones\nwe are made of skins and bones\nso when we break we can reform\n\nbridge\nho ho little child why do you run now tell me what you fear\nho ho little child is it love of holding someone near, near\n\nchorusx2\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zcc10XiVuMY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zcc10XiVuMY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zcc10XiVuMY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zcc10XiVuMY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zcc10XiVuMY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":759,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Zcc10XiVuMY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/8eqyOtZMPKvsg2vTzeHXHQlpjNk\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmYyb2Y0Z2kzbTlJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-03T04:57:56.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Playboy Manbaby - \"Cadillac Car\" Lolipop Records / Dirty Water Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Playboy Manbaby - \"Cadillac Car\" - Like this video?

Grimly sarcastic yet youthfully nihilistic music that seems to crash into things with a semi-coherent deliberation that can only be generated by a group of frail but over-caffeinated and eternally anxious young adults. Playboy Manbaby is the theme song to the sentiment “what the fuck am I doing with my life?” Indecisive in both message and genre but never lacking in sheer intensity.\n\nDirector Name: Ryan Riggs\nProducer Name: Robbie Pfeffer\n\nAbout the Video: Embrace the false excess.\n\nArtist Website:  http://www.playboymanbaby.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ButterGravyButter\n\nLabel Name: Lolipop Records (USA) / Dirty Water Records (UK)\n\nSong Lyrics:\nI woke up Thursday about 1 or 2\nI don’t got anything got anything to do\nI wanna brush my teeth, I need information\nTurn on the TV and radio station\nThe world’s fucked ain’t nothing left for me\nStrung out on fast-food, cigarettes, amphetamines\nI think today I’ll wear tight white dress\nThrow my hair in a tight perm press\n~~~\nI wanna Cadillac car\nA new hair do\nI wanna go to work and tell my boss, fuck you\n~~~\nI don’t like anything that anyone is telling me\nThey say it’s bad to have more than three felonies\nI got pulled over with two hookers and a pound of weed\nI don’t look sober, don’t look sober’s what they’re telling me\nI shot a man cause he looked at me wrong\nI feel indifferent as I have all along\nI shot a man cause he looked at me wrong\nI told a bunch of fucking lies in this song\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f2of4gi3m9I/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f2of4gi3m9I/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f2of4gi3m9I/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f2of4gi3m9I/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f2of4gi3m9I/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":760,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"f2of4gi3m9I"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/JV1m0VyZFDKD0Svpui2_XdG5rFc\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkhoSlgySTZNcUFn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T21:05:12.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Glitoris - \"Trump Card\" Buttercup Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Glitoris - \"Trump Card\" - Like this video?

Precise yet primitive jungle drums set the stage for the eclectic and powerful ensemble to sweep you away into their haunting world. Like oil and water, Durry's gravel voice alongside Mercedes's crystal clarity form a stirring, yet beautiful contrast. All being thrust forward by aggressive percussion, growling bass, and soaring brass. Their lyrics paint a thrilling picture of monsters and ghosts, murderers and thieves, love and guilt, and everything in between.\n\nDirector Name: Austin Durry\nProducer Name: Jarod Hadaway\n\nAbout the Video: Live footage from Icehouse\n\nArtist Website: http://www.marahinthemainsail.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/marahinthemainsail\nTwitter: @mitmband\nInstagram: @marahinthemainsail\n\nLabel Name: Last Triumph\nLabel Website: http://www.lasttriumph.com\n\nSong Lyrics: I don't wanna go back home. I don't want to see their bodies burn. Sweep up that ash and coal. I don't wanna see the slow heartbeat of the ember. I don't wanna be their scapegoat. Hiding their sins so nobody knows. Keeping them clean from the murder they wrote. I don't wanna see the slow heartbeat of the ember. Turning their skin to fur coats. Gliding my claws across their throats. Gutting them raw to protect my ego. I don't wanna see the slow heartbeat of the ember. Burn the woods. Burn them slow. Burn the trees, burn the bones. \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1ad1BxFfBY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1ad1BxFfBY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1ad1BxFfBY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1ad1BxFfBY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1ad1BxFfBY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":763,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"f1ad1BxFfBY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/PMKqmAQC1wKF272FMA51PI97ftQ\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Li1iYWlpMWNta0ZN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-05T20:40:59.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Testigo - \"She Burns\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Testigo - \"She Burns\" - Like this video?

Surely enough melodies are there, as well as harsh ‘deathlike’ screams. But The Swiss combo is as far as it gets from the old-school Gothenburg sound, thriving for a more modern and personal approach, fusing destructive riffs with melodic and electronic sound sampling. \nFronted by charismatic female-singer Stephany, backed by a solid musicianship, Deus Ex Machina is a must-see live. No wonder they have already been sharing the stage with acts such as Dagoba, Jinjer, Benighted and Sybreed, a.o. \nFounded in 2013, the band released its first EP, 'The Lament Before The Disaster' that same year. Three years and a few line-up changes later, they hit the Ignition Prod Studio in Geneva to record their first album 'A New World to Come', mixed\nand mastered at Conatus Studio and released on April 2017.\n\nDirector Name: Julien Dumont\nProducer Name: Titan Films / DBFX Workshop\n\nArtist Website: https://www.deusexmachinamusic.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deusexmachinamusic\nBandCamp: https://deusexmachina-music.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/deusexmachinamusic/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IPi7xbZ2okY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IPi7xbZ2okY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IPi7xbZ2okY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IPi7xbZ2okY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IPi7xbZ2okY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":767,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"IPi7xbZ2okY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/6lFdtWzmh6IaqWow_fvjeaaakpY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkxYSXVOV1hxNnJF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T22:19:36.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Nasty Toys - \"These Boots Are Made for Walking\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Nasty Toys - \"These Boots Are Made for Walking\" - Like this video?

They are wild. They are loud. They are the Time Shifters. Do they shift time to take you back to when rock‘n‘roll was raw? Sincere? Dangerous? Yes they do! At least they try their best. Do they know how to go there? Yes they do! As a matter of fact this combo was founded by none other than Vasilis himself, one of the original Czech punks, who knows what it is to piss off the communist police by forbidden gigs back in the 80s with his first punk band called Kecup, who later joins the still existing punkabilly The Gangnails to tour all over Europe with them.  But in 2016 Vasilis in need of new kind of kicks recruits new members and along with Pavel from France on bass sets up The Time Shifters a genuine old school punk rock‘n‘roll band: the fast paced songs are held together by Ales on the drums (also starring in The Dirty Blondes), and Vasilis‘ rhythmical drive is completed by Mara‘s wild riffs (ex. Barrockers, AntMafia)... this whole bunch is driven into battle by Kaja‘s powerful voice, a devilish she-daemon holding a microphone.\n\nDirector Name: Vasilis Nikolos\nProducer Name: Vasilis Nikolos\n\nAbout the Video: Recorded at the Professional Sound Studio, Prague, CZ. April 2017\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/T.Shifters/\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/timeshifters\nBandCamp: https://timeshifters.bandcamp.com\n\nSong Lyrics: Dirty Race \nit is fucking hard to tell when you gonna die\nand you don't even give a fuck as nobody will cry\nno breaks go down\nno breaks go down\nso if you wanna win the race and live like nowhere bound\nwe'll be there to play the show for your crazy hound\nno breaks go down\nno breaks go down\nyou feel the danger \nyou don't give a fuck \nyou are the danger \nyou not gonna stop\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ExhkxIpFe3c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ExhkxIpFe3c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ExhkxIpFe3c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ExhkxIpFe3c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ExhkxIpFe3c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":770,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ExhkxIpFe3c"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/h12JvmCiOM5nIFvGYlFQu6fbInY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlJQQ04wQk0wU1Iw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T04:48:08.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Ways. - \"I See No Beauty\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Sewer Rats - \"Waiting for a Letter\" - Like this video?

Lead singer Cameron Cole and guitarist Kalin Pugh spent a year building a strong core following in their home of San Diego before moving to London and forming the Dead 30 Artist collective with Austin Arthur and the rest of the members of The L.I.F.T. While in London, LTU completed their first studio EP titled N.W.O. that they plan to release in September. The band explores themes of breaking barriers in subjects such as politics, isolation, mental insanity and love, from a very aggressive and external point of view.  \n\nAbout the Video: The video for \"If You Find Me\" was shot, directed, and edited by lead singer Cameron Cole. After filming most of the performance shots, Cole locked himself in the room with nothing but the static TV for an entire night and filmed it, capturing feelings of isolation as a result of being trapped in there. The final video portrays a transparent or glitching visual of the band meant to symbolize his frequent feeling of disconnect from reality, and the feeling that so many have of barely hanging on, struggling to not let depression get the best of you every day. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.leavetheuniverse.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/leavetheuniverse\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/ltuniverse\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/leavetheuniverse \nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/leavetheuniverse\nSoundcloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/leavetheuniverse \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV\n\nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YqHNsCz7rzY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YqHNsCz7rzY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YqHNsCz7rzY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YqHNsCz7rzY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YqHNsCz7rzY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":775,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YqHNsCz7rzY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Vhq563KZiXwRMgI9afGA0mL7c0c\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlltckpWZEJmNVBV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-30T01:44:37.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Shamen Fox-Henry - \"Dad\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Shamen Fox-Henry - \"Dad\" - Like this video?

Mike was in his sophomore year at Rhode Island College studying business. Jared was working for the family business as an electrician and Jon was studying construction at NE Tech. All three of them saw the path they were heading on and decided that it was now or never. \" You can fail at something you don't want, so you mine as well take a chance at doing what you love.\" Jim Carrey. \n\nIn 2013 Noxii started playing out as a three piece as the hunt for more members became frustrating. After two years of writing songs and searching, they decided they might be better off finding other members by playing out. It was after this that Bass player Matt Perreault got wind. Matt attended the same high school as the guys in Noxii but graduated a few years a head of them. Matt and the guys thought that if they teamed up, they could really turn Noxii into something that had been envisioned in 2011. \n\nNoxii Arena played several shows in Rhode Island for a few years having trouble finding a vocalist that stuck. after they became \"vocaless\" for a third time, the band became stagnant. \n\nIn January of 2016 local vocalist Andrew Shea was looking for his next music project to take another shot at screaming in a metal band. Andrew grew up in Wakefield on the other side of Rhode Island but had heard of the guys through the scene. He knew that Noxii was looking for a vocalist and that's exactly what he became. \n\nNoxii Arena is a five piece metal band out of Rhode Island. \n\nAlbum Coming Soon.\n\nDirector Name: Kristian \nProducer Name:  Julian Mazzola \n\nAbout the Video: Zombies \n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/noxiiarena\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/noxiiarena \nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/noxiiarena \nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/noxiiarena \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vwl417-DWVk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vwl417-DWVk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vwl417-DWVk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vwl417-DWVk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vwl417-DWVk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":781,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Vwl417-DWVk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ljbsSFcuykxNY7reUY-0iTmiIh8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnA5M29ONkN5eUJj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T21:30:27.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Schoolyards - \"Comrades 2.0\" feat.

In the pulpit is Imperial Priestess Screaming Loz Sutch, her tiny frame belying the colossal power of her scorching oratory, spoken in languages assumed through centuries of time travel. Her backing band consists of battle worn soldiers of the Australian underground punk, stoner and metal scenes. Jaytanic Ritual (a/k/a Jay from Frenzal Rhomb) Inverted CruciFox (a/k/a Fox from Nancy Vandal), Search & DesTroy (aka Troy from Daredevil / Mortal Sin) and River Sticks (a/k/a Dean from Demolition High Style) have long forgotten their former existences and are now forever beholden to the mesmeric lure of the Imperial Priestess. \n\nDirector Name: Mike Foxall\nCinematographer: Jarrod O'Brien \n\nArtist Website: http://www.theneptunepowerfederation.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theneptunepowerfederation\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RiffManor\nBandCamp: https://theneptunepowerfederation.bandcamp.com/album/neath-a-shin-ei-sun\nInstagram: @theneptunepowerfederation\n\nLabel Name: Erotic Volcano Records\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdZCqh6uh38/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdZCqh6uh38/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdZCqh6uh38/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdZCqh6uh38/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdZCqh6uh38/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":783,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"IdZCqh6uh38"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/rLmwAqGplkvmgwTVCsqEzyocKUU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkFkWWFsV2Fadm1j","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-18T23:22:49.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Angertea - \"Sinking in Strain\" Inverse Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Angertea - \"Sinking in Strain\" - Like this video?

The band is made up of three members: Gergely Mihály: vocals/guitar, Miguel Peralta: bass and László Bárkai: drums.\nBy 2009 we had released three full length albums: 'Lélekvágy' (2002), 'Rushing Towards the Hateline' (2006) and 'Twenty-Eight Ways to Bleed' (2009)) published in Hungary, resulting in having a relatively small, but fanatic fan base around here.\nIn 2010, we were discovered by Grammy-winner-producer, Neil Kernon (Queensryche, Cannibal Corpse, Peter Gabriel, Judas Priest etc.), and the new 3-song-CD, 'Distrust' EP(2011) was mixed by him and mastered by Alan Douches (Sepultura, Mastodon, Dillinger Escape Plan etc.).\nIn 2011, we got signed to Norwegian Smash Fabric Records. Our fourth full length album came out worldwide in September, 2012. One song on the album features Billy Gould of Faith No More.\nIn March, 2016 we released our fifth full length studio album entitled 'Snakes in Blossom' through the Finnish label Inverse Records.\nWe call our style experimental-grunge-metal with unique features.\n\nDirector Name: Robert Stibal\nProducer Name: Robert Stibal\n\nAbout the Video: Snakes, dancing queens and band...\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/angerteahun\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/angertea\n\nLabel Name: Inverse Records\nLabel Website: http://www.inverse.fi\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdYalWaZvmc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdYalWaZvmc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdYalWaZvmc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdYalWaZvmc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdYalWaZvmc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":784,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"AdYalWaZvmc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/CS7RWMCGwnk6ELsU48IBlbLnkZU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmZsb19wQTVYY0Zr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-17T02:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Sewer Rats - \"Waiting for a Letter\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Sewer Rats - \"Waiting for a Letter\" - Like this video?

Walking the line between Stray Cats-cool, early 90s Social D. and old Rancid, the band sounds like Mr. Ness and Mr. Setzer were hanging out with Hank Williams, teaching him new skateboard tricks while drinkin’ beers on a hot summer night.\nTheir new album 'Heartbreaks & Milkshakes' takes the band to\nthe next level and sounds like a sugar-high vision of 90s oldschool\npop-punk with witty tongue-in-cheek humor and a greasy yet stylish 50s vibe. Delivering twelve catchy and well-crafted pop punk sing-a-longs about heartbreak, black-metal chicks and moving back in with your parents (again), The SEWER RATS are ready to hit the road worldwide in order to promote their new release (Rookie Records/ Europe) (Rude Runner/ Japan).\n\nAbout the Video: The Song is about waiting for a potential love letter from a girl which finally turns out to be a complete disappointment. So we figured it would be fun to have singer Chris waiting in front of different international locations and being all pissed-off.

Individually, Kali Masi were rebuilding themselves. Their respective bands had imploded, they were desperate to outrun the shell-shock and start over. In a basement in the Chicago suburbs where mildew crept up the wood-paneled walls, Kali Masi began writing their first EP. The band carved out a sonic space between the urgency of the punk and hardcore bands that were our foundation and the Midwestern Emo breeze that was sweeping through their towns at the time. But they wanted to be a counterpoint for the evergreen music scene that thrives in Chicago; to move with the current but never float on the surface. To write as many songs as they could in ways that they hadn’t heard before. So, they dug in our heels and started pushing. \nIn 2012 Kali Masi released '900 Feet Beneath'— a 7-song EP recorded in a basement that made its way around the United States by word of mouth, relentless touring, and bare-knuckle DIY self-promotion. From staple-crested telephone poles to the bowels of Reddit forums, the band blasted Kali Masi anywhere that they could. In 2013 Kali Masi released a 7-inch on Berserk Records titled 'Things I’ve Learned While Swallowing S Words', weaving tender vocal lines with deep cello groans over guitar-rock songs that were both self-analytical and straightforward. Their roots sunk deeper and they toured even harder, each time further away and for a longer period of time. The band cut their teeth on month-long stints to both American coasts and stretches of Canada. They wore through tire tread and brake line. They saw sun-soaked sunflower fields and snow-capped mountains. They traversed bad roads, bad shows, good friends and break downs (musical, mechanical and mental). Home began to feel subjective- a mobile, shape-shifting thing that was defined by the people rather than a name on a highway exit sign.\nWhen Kali Masi first got in the van, some of them were barely 18. They started touring as kids and when the wheels stopped spinning they were adults. By 2015 they had seen the entirety of the United States three times over. What began as adventurous had grown into routine. At home, there was a tangible change around them, a wind, and they were looking inside of ourselves to find out what was changing: about them, about their world, their future, and what this band meant. Borrowing from Fugazi (an Instrument is used to make a measurement), they titled this introspective chapter, and what would come to be their first full-length record, Wind Instrument. They worked with Jay Maas, an astounding engineer, musician, and now great friend to make the record. Together, Kali Masi set up camp at the legend-of-punk-lore Atlas Studios in Chicago and put pen to paper, piecing the fragmented parts of the past few years into some songs that they felt made sense of it all.\n\nDirector Name: Chris Bauer\nProducer Name: Chris Bauer\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/kalimasiband\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/kalimasiband\nBandCamp: http://www.kalimasi.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/kalimasiband\n\nLabel Name: Take This to Heart Records\nLabel Website: www.takethistoheartrecords.com\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jdzxwGJdHO8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jdzxwGJdHO8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jdzxwGJdHO8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jdzxwGJdHO8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jdzxwGJdHO8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":795,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jdzxwGJdHO8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/UH68N7dJv30-uwDa-Gkvrk77qUg\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlMxODFyNTBRR0RZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-17T03:27:31.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Deadpoint - \"The Grand Oppressor\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Deadpoint - \"The Grand Oppressor\" - Like this video?

The video for “Nothin' on Me” is a musical masterpiece directed by award-winning Rock Davis of Itchy House Films whose client list includes Atlantic Records, Universal Music Group, Def Jam Recordings, and Bad Boy Entertainment among numerous other industry heavyweights.\nAccording to Bree, “Nothin' on Me” is more than just a great song; it is an emblem for the identity of the band itself: “After that song was written, it was easy deciding on our name. Hideaway represents everything we believe our music to be: not only an escape but a safe haven. We had a blast writing and recording “Nothin' on Me,” which encourages those who are lost to stand up for what they love and believe in despite their self-doubt.”\nThere is much more to the band than their impressive sound; fans will be able to connect to a greater substance through underlying themes of positivity found in the group’s songs, a crucial element that Bree Rose maintains.\nPart of that substance no doubt stems from Bree’s relationship with twin brother Nick Lafelice (guitar). The two also share a long-time bond with Mike Moraes (drums) and Eric Drylewicz (bass and backup vocals), all of whom are Jersey-born and raised. “We’ve all been great friends for years, we share a love for groovy funk-pop music and performing,” says Rose.\n\nDirector Name: Itchy House Films \nProducer Name: Rock Davis - Itchy House Films\n\nArtist Website: http://www.HideawayBand.com\nFacebook: http://www.Facebook.com/Hideawaytheband\nTwitter: http://www.Twitter.com/Hideawaytheband\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/Hideawaytheband\nBandCamp: http://www.Hideawaytheband.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.Instagram.com/Hideawaytheband\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Nothin' on Me\"\n\nVerse\nI know my place\nAt this for days\nBut I’m here to stay\nNo nothing can replace\n\nCause’ you’ve got nothing on me\nYou’ve got nothing\n\nChorus\nWhen you stand for nothin’\nYou’ll crash-land\nLiving your life on your hands\nYou’ll never understand\nHow it feels to\nChase a dream\nSo much you’re losing sleep\nI need this like, like I need to breath\nIt takes everything\n\nVerse\nDon’t think you’re cute, no\nYou look confused\nThese ain’t your roots, no\nYou can’t do it like I do\n\nYou’ve got nothing on me\nYou’ve got nothing\n\nChorus\nWhen you stand for nothing\nYou’ll crash-land\nLiving your life on your hands\nYou’ll never understand\nHow it feels to\nChase a dream\nSo much you’re losing sleep\nI need this like, like I need to breath \nIt takes everything \n\nOo Oo\nx4\n\nChorus\nWhen you stand for nothing\nYou’ll crash-land\nLiving your life on your hands\nYou’ll never understand\nHow it feels to\nChase a dream\nSo much you’re losing sleep\nI need this like, like I need to breath \nIt takes everything \n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fnX2R9863a0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fnX2R9863a0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fnX2R9863a0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fnX2R9863a0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fnX2R9863a0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":802,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"fnX2R9863a0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/M6Vx_oJ0wmPr42_l5VNtTifF_EA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlFISUpOeWxjbTZV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-10T23:26:57.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Chuck Norris Experiment - \"Murder on My Mind\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The Chuck Norris Experiment - \"Murder on My Mind\" - Like this video?

By 2008, the band had played their very first US tour which saw the youthful riff maestros take in cities throughout California and Texas. \nThe inventive quartet then released their debut album 'Forgotten Silence' in 2010 via Copro Records.  Much acclaim and praise followed, and so too did further touring throughout the whole of the UK. By June 2013, the quartet dropped a new EP, 'Tomorrow', along with their first video single \"Why Are We Still Living in the Yesterdays?\". The band then went on to release another EP in 2015, 'Awakening,' which is a hefty piece of a progressive and psychedelic ambient rock that will delve into your inner core.\nThe Lotus are currently working on their second full length album with Paul Reeve (Muse) at the helm, and this record promises to be their best work to date.\n\nDirector Name: Luca De Falco Artworks\nProducer Name: Barn Owl Productions\n\nAbout the Video: \"Perfect Love'\" is a song that about love and desire, by going through an unusual path: the guilt.\nThe society we're living today has built its relational fundamentals on dogmatic hypocrisy that are opposite to what is the root of human being.\nIn our century of pious and religious imperialism, we are forced to justify our instincts by blaming ourselves, and that makes us aliens in our home.\nSo, who can tell us what is a Perfect Love? How can you escape the fruits of decay growing on us?\nTruth, sharing, and understanding are the keys to free our souls.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.the-lotus.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thelotusofficial\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/thelotusband\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/thelotus\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thelotusbandofficial\n\nLabel Name: Barn Owl Records\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Perfect Love\"\n\nI will not live the hypocrisy of concrete Lord punish me, punish me for my sins I feel the disease of your black lace Lord punish me cause I want you to hear my prayers\n\nI tied her wrists to the dreams of my desire I tied her soul to the moan of my pride Her body surrendered to my Perfect Love\n\nShe lost her defences\nto my Perfect Love\n\nHide the nature\nBury it\nIt's a disease\nIt's your disease\n\nThe fruits of decay grow inside of me\nLord punish me, punish me for my sins\n\nI tied her wrists to the dreams of my desires I tied her soul to the moan of my pride Her body surrendered to my Perfect Love She lost her defences to my Perfect Love\n\nI tied her wrists to the dreams of my desires I tied her soul to the moan of my pride Her body surrendered to my Perfect Love She left her defences to my Perfect Love\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6b3-0_WN-8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6b3-0_WN-8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6b3-0_WN-8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6b3-0_WN-8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6b3-0_WN-8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":804,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"o6b3-0_WN-8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/mW_Vr4XBrPXUXTzK_6i15-R5Lko\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmRtdTZoaWNSdVlZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-10T21:58:45.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Searching for Something - \"Abandon All\" Official Live Video - 2017","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Searching for Something - \"Abandon All\" - Like this video?

Born near the disaster stricken ruins of Chernobyl, KORR-A was brought to the United States to inquire about health complications she suffered as a result of the plant explosion. She was as a child in the U.S. where she began to fall in love with 90’s hip-hop and pop hits and the dance moves of icons like Michael and Janet Jackson.\nShe relocated back to Ukraine to reunite with her parents where she began dance and singing lessons. Finally, she returned back to the U.S. to pursue her dream of attending Pepperdine University in Malibu and launching her music career. Relentless and dedicated KORR-A reemerged on the music scene in 2013 with her explosive her smash “Fiyacraka.” Crafted by Grammy-nominated producer, Dave Aude—who has scored over 83 #1 Billboard dance hits— “Fiyacraka” reached #18 on the Billboard Dance Club Charts, #12 on UK’s Music Week Commercial Pop Charts, and #7 on the DJ Times National Dance/Crossover Charts.\nIn 2015 KORR-A aligned with Tearce “Kizzo,” who has worked his sonic magic with everyone from Afrojack and Inna to Jason Derulo, Pitbull and Ne-Yo. They delivered “Swipe Right” —a whimsical spin on the Tinder/Grinder apps and the modern dating world. She followed up “Swipe Right” with another Kizzocollabo as he helped her add a provocative touch to ”C&C Music Factory’s 1990 #1 hit “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” on her hit “Everybody Get Down.” The visuals garnered more than half a million views on YouTube and her next single continued to solidified her road to success. “Touch Me Like You Mean It” – which she debuted at the Fusion Radio 10th Anniversary event in Chicago—marked more chart success. The track peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Dance Charts. With her new single “Trapped” KORR-A is exploring her vocals and stepping into her own as an over all entertainer dedicated to getting the party started and giving you a reason to dance.\n\nDirector Name: Jensen Noen / Scissor Films\nProducer Name: Sam Malko\n\nAbout the Video: The \"Cali Love\" single is a dope Dance EDM mix produced by Jared Overeem of Overdive Productions. \n\nArtist Website: http://www.korr-a.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/Korramusic\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/Korr_a\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/KORRAMUSIC\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/Korr_a\n\nLabel Name: Nabrok Records\nLabel Website: http://www.korr-a.com\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_vFwE9ldKBU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_vFwE9ldKBU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_vFwE9ldKBU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_vFwE9ldKBU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_vFwE9ldKBU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":809,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_vFwE9ldKBU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/9Em0zUibaWer9himiLGt2wu24GI\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm5USWNQYkZFY2Nr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-17T06:04:20.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Stay Out - 'End of the East Bay' Official Album Teaser & Release Show - 10/13/17","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Stay Out - 'End of the East Bay' Official Album Teaser & Release Show - 10/13/17 - Like this video?

Never wanted days like these while we are young.\nChorus:\nBut some feelings they never die.\nAnd it haunts a piece of me tonight. \nAnd they send you another life to settle where you come from.\nTwenty-four hit us hard and gave us another meaning.\nIt happened to your daddy, you swore it'll never happen to you.\nBut mama had another past she dragged you into. \nBut no. Never wanted days like these while we are young.\nChorus:\nBut some feelings they never die.\nAnd it haunts a piece of me tonight. \nAnd they send you another life to settle where you come from.\nAnd we'll run where the broken hearts are.\nAnd we'll run where the broken hearts are.\nYou say you're lonely and damaged tonight.\nBut I'll be the one to let you know when your sweet taste is gone.\nChorus:\nBut some feelings they never die.\nAnd it haunts a piece of me tonight. \nAnd they send you another life to settle where you come from.\nWe'll run where the broke hearts are.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwVoZpe6vkE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwVoZpe6vkE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwVoZpe6vkE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwVoZpe6vkE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":811,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FwVoZpe6vkE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/60Rj-azgiCveqX1yqpkAUBjWl6g\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmVZOUl1VWgzeE5B","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-12T22:38:55.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Chuck Blaze - \"Get Rich\" MeaninFul Music LLC","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - Chuck Blaze - \"Get Rich\" - Like this video?

KrankTV.com!\n \n***\nUnHuman Insurrection - \"The Edge of Nothing\" Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: Monselice, Italy\n\nArtist Biography: UnHuman Insurrection is an Italian metal band formed in 2016, risen from the ashes of “Burn of Black” (one EP published in 2013). UHI's musical identity is a powerful mix of aggressive and harsh sounds, blended with melodic vocals which emphasize the sonorities. The band steps into the music scenario with the full length named 'Equilibrium?'. The album is the personal outcome of the individual maturation process every band member came across, breeding their new identity born by the union of the heavy rhythmic patterns typical of Industrial Metal, the violence of Thrash, topping them with clean melodic vocals, like it’s rarely done and expected in such cases. The core of “Equilibrium?” finds its perfect expression thanks to the production by DysFUNCTION team, in cooperation with Giuseppe Bassi and Eddy Cavazza. The album’s name is purposefully chosen and entirely represents the band’s mood and soul to date, besides describing the thin balance hanging between opposite styles, until they finally mix and find their strength and solidity.\n\nDirector Name: Alessio Libraon - Wom Videos\nProducer Name: Alessio Libraon - Wom Videos\n\nAbout the Video: This is the first full video clip by UnHuman Insurrection\n\nArtist Website: http://www.unhumanband.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/unhumaninsurrection/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unhumanband\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/unhumaninsurrection/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9BuYc2JuTio/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9BuYc2JuTio/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9BuYc2JuTio/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9BuYc2JuTio/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9BuYc2JuTio/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":815,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9BuYc2JuTio"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/6RBpqXtDqS813k9DFwndiQWYkO8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lnh1VGE0VnBTcFZJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-13T00:32:26.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Come the Spring - 'Echoes' Engineer Records - Official Album Teaser","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Come the Spring - 'Echoes' Official Album Teaser - Like this video?

After this successful event, all came with an idea of formally pursuing this hybrid experimental project and by blending of individual differences in music relatively which later called Sunflower Project (an homage to the game Plants Vs.

Realization of Respect, Acceptance, and Unity. \nStoryline: A painting session of an old man (representing the past) & a girl (representing the present) facing to each other (both actions indicate competing with their craft). The old man arrogantly brags a girl by his skills in traditional painting & acting as a dominant. And the girl seems to ignore the old man using her bare hands as the modern way with confidence. At the end of the session, their output will reveal and will notice both are almost the same.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/sunflowerprojectcavite\nBandcamp: http://sunflowerprojectcavite.bandcamp.com/album/stitching-lost-sides-of-falling-memories-ep\n\nSong Lyrics: \nMy God, please help me on this one\nThe signs of occurrences had just begun\nMy mind is crossing on a pathway and ripping apart\nOblique implications of complicated uneven explicit\nHonest way of regrets but repeatedly chosen\nHopelessly progressive or monotonous\nBless this mess!\nOpen your eyes, standout!

Pointed out as a Melodic death metal or metalcore band by different genre purist, but Eyes Wide Open’s soul lies within the melody, big choruses and their catchy riffs. \nWith ”And so it begins” the Eyes Wide Open trilogy is finally complete. Starting with ”Revelations” to tell us whats about to come if we continue to leech on this planet and ”Aftermath” how we may or may not live through it. \n”And so it begins” takes on the perspective of today, where we stand with all of our problems like wars, environmental disasters and our addiction to luxury. Will the revelations come true? \nWith the sudden departure of vocalist Patrik Fahlin, Eyes Wide Open had to evolve and Erik stepped up as their new vocalist. \nErik says: People probably thought we were done for when Patrik left us, but we pulled through big time. And now I don´t hesitate to say we are better than ever. With ”And so it begins” we prove ourselves among the top players and now I´m just thrilled to get out there to kick some ass. \n\nEyes Wide Open is:\n\nErik Engstrand – Vocals\nKristofer Strandberg – Guitars\nJesper Lindgren – Bass\nKarl Adamsson – Drums\n\nDirector Name: Erik Engstrand\nProducer Name: ES Music\n\nArtist Website: http://www.e-w-o.net\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/EyesWideOpenOfficial\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/eyes.wide.open.swe\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/ewo_swe\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/weareewo\nSoundCloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/eyeswideopenswe\n\nLabel Name: Headbang Entertainment\n\nSong Lyrics: \"Defining Me\"\n\nStep inside\nInto the darkest corner of my mind\nWhere shadows fill the sunlight\nEverything seems so right\n\nPulling every lever in my sight\nI dare you just step inside\n\nInto a place where demons seem divine\nWhere your nightmares come alive\n\nThis is where your nightmares come alive\nAlive, alive, alive\n\nLooking for something new\nI brave the harshest winter\nDefining, designing\nDeep down I think there's more of me\nReroute the path\nThe wrath\nHolds me no more\n\nI tell you\nJust stay outside\n\nFrom my inner sanctum so malign\nA way of hate by my design\nThis is a realm where night and day collide\nIn the eye of the storm\nI will confide\n\nLooking for something new\nI brave the harshest winter\nDefining, designing\nDeep down I think there's more of me\nReroute the path\nThe wrath\nHolds me no more\n\nNo more no more no more\nI brave the harshest winter\nNo more no more\nDefining me\nNo more no more \nI brave the harshest winter\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_4Lis6l1obA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_4Lis6l1obA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_4Lis6l1obA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_4Lis6l1obA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_4Lis6l1obA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":818,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_4Lis6l1obA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/0JJIA4t4E7_PQKx2kYksMVYentQ\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lm01Q1JLbEhhM0VF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-10T22:45:51.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Diploma - \"Lauralie\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Diploma - \"Lauralie\" - Like this video?

Though it all started when a few friends got together to just jam and have a little fun it soon became obvious that there was something special going on. It didn't take long for the ideas to start flowing and songs began taking form. After a few member shuffles the band solidified and things really started to move forward for the band.\nThrough their own brand of Heavy Rock n Roll and high energy live performances they began gaining notice in the local music scene. That attention has gotten them the opportunities to play with National and Regional bands such as Texas Hippy Coalition, Messer, Hounds of Jezebel and more. They recently released their first single “Better Man” to iTunes and other online retailers and it has also been getting radio airplay, they are in the process of recording their first full album.\nWhile RNC has their own style and sound and don't attempt to emulate or fit into a mold, fans of music in the vein of Metallica, Pantera, Godsmack, Five Finger Death Punch, Down etc... will more than likely enjoy the music of Rear Naked Choke.\n\nDirector Name: Scott Rudd\nDirector Website: http://scottdrudd.wixsite.com/srfilm\n\nAbout the Video: The song \"Suicide Betsy\" is about a Motorcycle so we wanted to make sure that even in the Lyric Video that we have that represented.\nOnce we started talking with the director of the vid he really wanted to use the background art of the Album in the video, so we came up with the idea of using our mascot HD as in there as well kinda riding through this Post Apocalyptic landscape. It's nothing too serious but it keeps things visually interesting as the lyrics pop up.\n\nArtist Website: http://www.RNCtheBand.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RNCMusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RNC_the_Band\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/rearnakedchokemusic\n\nSong Lyrics:\nShe's black on black\nGot a 5 gleam split tank\nHammered Steel for a Seat\nThere’s no front breaks, Just 18 inch Apes\n7 degrees on the Trees, Super E\n \n4 speed transmission, \na foot clutch\nSlap it and pull it and push, push\nShe's Suicide\nSlap it and pull it and push, push\nShe's Suicide\nSlap it and pull it and push\nShe's All American Steel\n \nSuicide\nSuicide Betsy Ride On\nSuicide\nSuicide Betsy you’re Motorcycle Sexy\nRide On\n \nHer Engine is Hot but His Bones are Froze\nThe years that his leather jacket shows\nWhite Knuckles grip her Suicide\nThe Cold Wind Blows but he don't mind\n \n4 speed transmission, a foot clutch\nSlap it and pull it and push, push\nShe's Suicide\nSlap it and pull it and push, push\nShe's Suicide\nSlap it and pull it and push\nShe's All American Steel\n \nSuicide\nSuicide Betsy Ride On\nSuicide\nSuicide Betsy you’re Motorcycle Sexy\nRide On\n \nSo here we roll on, And on\nHere we roll on, Yeah, Yeah\nI'm Gone\n \nSuicide Betsy I'm Gone\nSuicide Betsy\n \nHere we go down the road, watch us roll, rumble low, Never Slow, Here we go\nSuicide Betsy Ride On\nHere we go down the road, watch us roll, rumble low, Never Slow\nSuicide Betsy you’re Motorcycle Sexy\nI’m gone\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/As2suxRylo4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/As2suxRylo4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/As2suxRylo4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/As2suxRylo4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/As2suxRylo4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":822,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"As2suxRylo4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/8fiMs8Voab8rcsHIbQJAExoGIwo\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjNqYWRpZkRqd0ZJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-29T02:22:27.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Bokassa - \"Crocsodile Dundee\" All Good Clean Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Bokassa - \"Crocsodile Dundee\" - Like this video?

In 2014, Weston started recording his songs with Athens, Georgia, producer Matt Martin. The songs they assembled over the next two years comprise ayo river’s debut LP Failed State. These songs are Weston’s internal tales of loss and miscommunication in the wildly connected age of the internet, brought to life with sweeping indie-pop influenced writing and production.\n\nDirector Name: Chad Tennies\nProducer Name: Resolve Media Group\nAbout The Video:  This is a song about the way people come in and out of your life with no warning, and the effects their sudden arrivals and departures can have on you. I was in a car crash last year that woke me up out an existential coma, reminded me how fragile life is and how quickly it can be taken away from you. I had been feeling really down about where I was at. I’d finished school in the same city I’d grown up in, seen so many friends start new lives with successful jobs in other places while I was still mowing over the same ground, not doing much. The crash snapped me out of that self pity kind of feeling, made me less concerned with comparing my life to the lives of others and more involved with taking advantage of everything in front of me. It took something out of the blue and life threatening like that to wake me up. \n\n    With the video, we wanted to convey that sense of lives intersecting, for better or for worse. All the paths cross in a seemingly random way, but a connection emerges out of them, and change ensues. It's a play around the line \"People come, people go, no one really knows\", which is the core of the song to me.\n\nArtist Website:  ayoriver.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ayorivermusic/\n\n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AyoRiverMusic\n\n\n\nMyspace: N/A\n\nReverbNation: N/A\n\nBandCamp: https://ayoriver.bandcamp.com/releases\n\n\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ayo_river/\n\n\n\nOther: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0ZYU5RCC1trSNeIpwBorlL\n\nSong Lyrics:\nSo I guess that we’re not invited\nTo the party out on the westside \nMe and all of my friends decided \nWe’d be better off as strangers\nAfter Megan moved out to Denver\nI came home to ashes and embers\nStarted swiping left on Tinder\nAnd fantasized about my funeral\n\nI was introduced to a lady\nWhen she crashed her brand new Mercedes\nThrough a red light, straight into me\nShe screamed and asked “are you alright?”\nSo I said, well, thanks for asking\nAt this point I don’t care what happens\nWe stood there causing the traffic\nAnd laughed and had ourselves and awkward hug\n\nWho says you can’t go home again\nIt's all just something someone said\nMy eyes can only document\nSo much before they close again\n\nPeople come people go\nNo one really knows\nGoing out on the town\nTill we drown our woes\n\nWho says you can’t go home again\nIt's all just something someone said\nMy eyes can only document\nSo much before they close again\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_4udSVYLUE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_4udSVYLUE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_4udSVYLUE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_4udSVYLUE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_4udSVYLUE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":830,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"J_4udSVYLUE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/dGSBkiebc2IYO8iyVrovpg7MA1k\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lkw0Rl9OcEpuSTNB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-06T06:07:15.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"DoubleMotorcycle - \"Pyramid\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - DoubleMotorcycle - \"Pyramid\" - Like this video?

Go Away!\" A BlankTV World Premiere!\n\nArtist city, country: Moscow, Russia\n\nArtist Biography: Punk has the power to cross time, oceans, and even make it out of the claws of Russia virtually unscathed. Formed in 1988 in Moscow, NAIVE did something that is hard to believe - they were unabashedly punk in Russia. Did it matter that they were ten years after the first wave of punk in the more western parts of Europe? Not really. They flew in the face of everything that was \"right\" and \"good\" in Russia. \nProudly anti-communist, they even set up in front of the Russian parliament to play a show and proclaim that \"Boris Yeltsin is an asshole.\" NAIVE has the distinction of being the first Russian punk to have music released to a US audience, fittingly enough by the still thriving zine Maximum Rock and Roll. The band partied hard, drank a lot (which is the case with many punks and many Russians), lost band members to drugs, moved to US for a time, and still put out fast, furious rock that explored self-destruction, rallied against being a cog in the machine, and got popular enough to be on Russian radio. After nine albums, it's clear that these guys have the punk ethos and sound down which should not surprise anyone after almost 30 years of sticking to their guns. Fast, loud, ferocious punk. Think NOFX or early Green Day but soaked in vodka and the reality of growing up in the Soviet Union and living in modern day authoritarian Russia.\n\nDirector Name: John DeFazio\nProducer Name: Thomas Budrys\n\nAbout the Video: The film was shot in Los Angeles & Moscow, the live part was filmed and mixed in famous Russia' s capital venue Izvestial Hall by All Star TV company. The production part of the video in Los Angeles was done by Timeline Entertainment. Timeline Entertainment was established in 2004 in Los Angeles by the head producer and C.E.O Andrey Prikazchikov, who is a great long time friend of NAIVE. \n\nSubtitles: Dmitry Sheblakin\nCover Art: Nikia Lyschin\n\nArtist Website: http://www.naive.ru/\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/naiveofficial/\nYouTube: http://youtube.com/naiverock\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/naiveofficial\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/naiveofficial\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/naiveofficial\nOther: http://vk.com/naive\n\nLabel Name: Soyuz\nLabel Website: http://www.soyuz.ru/\n\nSong Lyrics: \nTRUMP!

Youri Raymond (Unhuman) - Official Music Video\n\nArtist city, country: Guelph, Ontario, Canada\n\nArtist Biography: Becomes Astral is a progressive death metal band based out of Guelph, Ontario. Formed in the later months of 2013, they quickly got to work on releasing their debut EP, 'The Mind', which was released in October 2014. The Mind was recorded and mixed by Don Levasseur at Atlantic Studio. After their debut release, Becomes Astral toured heavily for the following year, covering west coast Canada, and two Ontario and Quebec tours. Playing steadily since, Becomes Astral has made themselves a force to be reckoned with, allowing the band to sell out half of their last tour in Ontario. In early 2016, Becomes Astral took a break from playing live to write a full-length record, and returned to shows in late 2016. In December 2016 the band entered The Grid Studios in Montreal, QC with Christian Donaldson of Cryptopsy as a producer and came out with a piece of music they are proud to call their own, 'Paleblood Sky'. \n\nDirector Name: Martin Trottier of Darkest Media\n\nAbout the Video: \"The Glass Lake\" is a song that begins with a joyous sound then quickly turns on it's head to show you the instability we all feel in everyday life. \"The Glass Lake\" is a term coined by an eccentric acquaintance of the vocalist, Cam Sherer. He used this term to describe the downfall of humanity saying it's only a matter of time before we hit 'the glass lake.' What Sherer aims to convey through these lyrics is that we must be conscious of our impact on what we often forget, how it is a fragile existence and can very suddenly become detrimental toward our initial momentum. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BecomesAstral/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becomesastral\nBandCamp: https://becomesastral.bandcamp.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becomesastral2.0/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K3lUvzF8QrM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K3lUvzF8QrM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K3lUvzF8QrM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K3lUvzF8QrM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K3lUvzF8QrM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":854,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"K3lUvzF8QrM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/PWex5PwEYNrL2IDx_MLsCA0L_W4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmttMTViS0xpcUlj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-02T01:27:05.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Azwel - \"Night on the Town\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Azwel - \"Night on the Town\" - Like this video?

He wrote/engineered/arranged the music. The instrumentation on the album includes a wide array of instruments. Aside from the typical guitars and keyboards there are lots of strings, woodwind and brass sounds. Styles range from pop rock, acoustic, britpop, baroque pop etc. Lyrical themes involve loss, altercation, depression, and general storytelling as the moods change from song to song.\nUp until a few years ago Azwel just consisted of Jason Perrillo but now there is a full live band consisting of Joe Lorge (guitar/backing vocals) Gregg Steele (bass/backing vocals), Johnny Zaletel (drums/percussion), and occasional live member, Randy Bennis(Keyboards.) The sound is catchy, memorable and often compared to britpop/rock artists.\nMost of the albums are available to download for free on the official website with the choice of optional donations depending on how much the listener enjoys the album.\n\nDirector Name:  Steve Orfanos\n\nAbout the Video: Shot in Bellmore, NY, it's about someone who tries to go out for an escape but it backfires.\n\nWebsite Link: http://www.azwel.com\nFacebook Link: http://www.facebook.com/azwel\nBandcamp Link: http://www.bandcamp.com/azwel\nReverbnation Link: http://www.reverbnation.com/azwel\n\nSong Lyrics:\nWandering round, they followed us out\nWe never failed to make a scene\nThrown to the floor\nAnd welcome no more\nLike a sad sack ought to be\nA night on the town  could express the town\nThey couldnt contain me\nAll of a sudden they would say im through\nThats how long it takes me\nShoved to the ground \nAnd nothing was found\nIn our heads we played the part\nNothing to fear, our mission is clear \nAnd we dont need to work that hard\nI will seem so frightened\nAlbeit enligtened\nInner self is an issue and i wont be with you no more\nUtterly fab though enticingly sad \nIn the eyes of our family\nSuffered this fate for vanities sake\nBut at least weve become out of reach\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/km15bKLiqIc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/km15bKLiqIc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/km15bKLiqIc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/km15bKLiqIc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/km15bKLiqIc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":855,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"km15bKLiqIc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ISnldfdMwMvMlvOoD75zd8NVJKs\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmpMajBfRE5DZTJJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-22T04:15:29.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Instable Collective - \"Losers and Winners\" Ghost Label Record","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Instable Collective - \"Losers and Winners\" - Like this video?

How and when this shit ended. And what you're doing now. It's fucked up. Whether you see it or not. The dead soul inside you is already coming out. Beauty's skin deep. And your flesh is slowly rotting away. \nChorus: You made me believe This make believe story Of being your knight in shining armor. Protecting you from evil. But I've moved on. And now it seems you'll be living Unhappily ever after. And with this pen I'll write your end. \nVerse 2: I'll never get back the time. I wasted on you. Hours of my life you've killed. And your cold heart won't save you from Fire. You're punishment is Fire. Go burn in hell. \nChorus You made me believe This make believe story Of being your knight in shining armor. Protecting you from evil. But I've moved on. And now it seems you'll be living Unhappily ever after. And with this pen I'll write your end. \nVerse 3 Try picking up the shattered pieces of your shallow dreams. Knowing that you have lost me forever. The shards of glass cut you deep . Don't stop just bleed. I'll show you sympathy. As much as you showed me. And I'll call this sympathetic torture. Breakdown: Bitch just bleed. Bitch just bleed.\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lfDcStaaqeI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lfDcStaaqeI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lfDcStaaqeI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lfDcStaaqeI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lfDcStaaqeI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":859,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lfDcStaaqeI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/UH6x9Z50gSf45TYi9yin46a7BXE\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjFSdUk3TS1JM1E4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-21T08:52:28.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Kalibre - \"Tears of the Dead\" Illuminate Productions","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Kalibre - \"Tears of the Dead\" - Like this video?

Ti si dao sve, sve sto si imao, izgleda da nije dovoljno. Tvoji dani su postali, sivi, tmurni i bezlicni, u vrtlogu sudbine, pitas se - zasto bas ti? Zlobno cerekaju se, zvjeri kamene, spremno cekaju tvoje udarce. Jos uvijek nadas se, da mozes promjeniti sve, ali kasno je, kasno za tebe. Nema predaje, nema predaje, stisni zube, ne misli na poraze\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yJ-0p3Fb1Y0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yJ-0p3Fb1Y0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yJ-0p3Fb1Y0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yJ-0p3Fb1Y0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yJ-0p3Fb1Y0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":861,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"yJ-0p3Fb1Y0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/XJ51XBx39UkvEAFvCjrlBpQjNgU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmRla2FaVU5rTm5V","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-26T00:37:11.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Celestial Sun - \"Genesis\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Celestial Sun - \"Genesis\" - Like this video?

Just as important is the music scene's ability to recognize who they are & give them the support they deserve as fuel to persevere in an industry which can be just as brutal as the music it promotes. Mourning Sun is definitely one of these bands! I recently came across the band's new EP, 'Therapy Sessions' & was not only taken aback by the splendid mix of brutal metalcore breakdowns & vocal diversity, but by the deep lyrical content from vocalist, James Vaughn Lubbering, who shares his inner demons on songs like, 'Ships Set to Sail' & the telling, 'Son of No Man'. Holistically, I found 'Therapy Session' to be a focal representation of the 2nd generation of talent to surface in the wake of their successful predecessors (in the likes of Upon A Burning Body & Darkness Divided) who have solidified SA as a breeding ground for metal talent of the highest grade. Thus, I felt compelled to get the band in front of our cameras to discuss their evolution, the year long recording of TS at Artik Studios, performance goals for the rest of the year, their memories of The White Rabbit & what we can expect from them in 2017. I would encourage the extended RMW familia to check out this band! You can hear TS on Bandcamp & if ya dig, then show your support by buying their music. We will surely be keeping up with them as they have so much more to offer & deliver to music fans in the future. As I close, I want to send a shout out to my industry bro, Joel Spielman at Patient Zero PR for connecting us to the band & getting us what we needed to do our thing.\" ~ El Mero Metal, Robert L Chavez\n\nDirector Website: https://www.youtube.com/robbsmetalworks\nDirector Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/robbsmetalworks/\n\nArtist Website: https://www.facebook.com/MourningSunTX/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MourningSunTX/\nBandCamp: https://mourningsuntx.bandcamp.com/album/therapy-sessions\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mourningsuntx/?hl=en\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m2s3GVQcZqo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m2s3GVQcZqo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m2s3GVQcZqo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":863,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"m2s3GVQcZqo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/gTVrOTseQuaZBE9ZWtYriyToug4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Ljlhc2NDZS1UYkpZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-02T02:55:55.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Depreciate the Liar - \"The Path to Hell\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Depreciate the Liar - \"The Path to Hell\" - Like this video?

With a solid deathcore sensibility, the band immediately started writing songs. When they played the first concerts they realized that a lot of people were confused to hear something different than metal, hardcore. So the band determined to produce the EP 'Broken Structure', which was available for everybody and free to download. \nIn 2012 the band was signed by Noisehead Records. \n\nIn March 2014 the long awaited first album 'Dethrone Humanity', recorded in cooperation with producer Mario Jezik, was released. \n\nDirector Name: Poseidon Media\nProducer Name: Poseidon Media\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DepreciateTL\nBandCamp: https://depreciatetl.bandcamp.com/\nContact: depreciate_the_liar@hotmail.com\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com/\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://www.blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ascCe-TbJY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ascCe-TbJY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ascCe-TbJY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ascCe-TbJY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ascCe-TbJY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":864,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9ascCe-TbJY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/P8R0s-_9JJBE5uAS_S3HXOgbUn4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkQ5eEZCWnR3VlM0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-20T06:37:23.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Amycanbe - \"White Slide\" Open Productions - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Amycanbe - \"White Slide\" - Like this video?

In 1996 the band recorded his first album, called “Victims”, supposed to come out through the Italian Nosferatu Records, but the label suddenly closed down just before printing the cd copies and the album Victims remained unpublished. This was a hard stroke to the band, in 1998 only two former members went on playing and Sepolcral were re-named Psycollapse, with a new drummer and second guitarist, without bass player. After a 4-tacks promo cd and some live shows the band split-up in 2002.\n\nAlmost a decade after, in late 2011, the former singer Denis unfortunately died and in 2012 four members between the two previous line-ups decided to pay a tribute to their lost friend and Sepolcral rose up from the dead, with two singers. As a 6-piece band they recorded a new EP between 2013 and 2014, so called “Reborn 6”.\n\nLine - Up\nDan- vocals\nChris- guitar\nFazz-guitar\nKev- bass\nAleks-drum\n \nAbout the Video: An horned masked slasher.

We started playing, kicking people and breaking stuff together in 2015. We really like free activities like jumping, running and making fun of our existential crises. Because we really don't have any money, and we all work as waiters and some other part-time jobs, so yeah. And as we said, we live in Turkey, which is an incredibly free country, our government officials really respect our freedom of speech, our well-being, our mental health. Also they really respect the people who are suffering because of them. So, they are just trying to end our suffering with police brutality, with controlling the mainstream media, with throwing journalists and opposing party members (even leaders) in prisons, with using religion as a tool to fool our really fool so called citizens, who are tools. But we know it, this is just for us! They are so thoughtful! Our songs are mostly about this, about us trying to survive, about us having no money, about how crooked politics and religious stuff in this shithole, about how it is to live in a middle eastern country, and about our boredom and our anger. We released our first EP 'Re-Vizyon' in 2016 and our debut album 'Bugün' (it means \"Today\" in English) in 2017. We play fast punk rock music with some melodic stuff.\n\nDirector Name: Mutlu Oral\nProducer Name: Mutlu Oral\n\nAbout the Video: Loom Handcrafts shot, directed and edited this video.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/padmeband0233\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/padmeband\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/padme0233\nBandCamp: http://www.padme0233.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/padmeband/ \n\nSong Lyrics: Sana söylenecek bir ton laf var \nZamanı gelince anlayacaksın Geçiyor saniyeler görünüyor ufuklar Bir sonraki gelişimizde çok şaşıracaksın Çok yücelttin kendini, yaktın merdivenleri Düşüşün de kaçınılmaz var bir sertliği Sattın ticareti, ama^ biziz sanki Semadan çok küçük görünür yerdeki Üzerimize yürüsen ne olur Bir koşsanız Bombalar elinde uyuyadur Biz hep ayaktayız Kendin yaktın kendini sattın, Sattın kendini Arka odalarda kimliksiz kaldın.

Inspired by bands such as Nightwish or Rhapsody (of Fire) and great composers such as Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Alan Silvestri, Ennio Morricone or Igor Stravinski, WonderOnce is a metal band which varies from the basic \"metal band with synth/orchestra\" to a more ambitious project which is to create an epic movie score mixed with harsh and light metal as well as other elements from other genres. Each song has its own lyrical theme varying from legends across various cultures, songs about fantasy elements or downright original stories. \n\nAbout the video: The shooting of the video took place in a forest (suitable setting associated with the Celtic theme) where many where we searched for an image that would perfectly match the epic feeling we were looking for. All this is thanks to Henry Menacho who made the experience really dynamic.\n\nArtist Website: www.wonderonce.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wonderonce/\nTwitter: https://www.facebook.com/wonderonce/\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3sD2sZtlpb8lrpqAAvkVvw\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/wonderonce\nBandcamp: https://wonderonce.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nSong Lyrics: Badb, macha and the true morrigan\nLay down your eye for the war has begun\nVictors to be, proud men you will see\nWe are the ones to die as your sons\nFirst rays of the sun come out from the mountains\nClench your first for the war\nOutsiders from south in steel and lead\nSign of the eagle above their head\nWith us we win, in us you can trust\nSo we can turn their life to dust\nIn the celtic lands death is our ally\nWe kill for her and die for her\nIn the Celtic lands death is our ally\nPray to the divine to give us a sign\nMorrigan (spread out your wings)\nFly with us (into the sky) to the sun\n(Fly with your men) to then kill and kill and kill again\nYou will not take our lands, we will not be yours\nYou better know we will fight you till you’re gone\nFly across the tainted lands\nShow the beauty they will never see\nGive the strength they will never have\nOh Morrigu, we pray to you Morrigu\n(Fly with your men) to then\nKill and kill and kill till the sunset\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogEwNwZ93DE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogEwNwZ93DE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogEwNwZ93DE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogEwNwZ93DE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogEwNwZ93DE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":885,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ogEwNwZ93DE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/BRptzXoLvJdsI4Yqg1IMAxeI_TI\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlR1YUI5dDZRSk1z","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-05T04:34:38.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Acid Blood - \"Wartimes\" JanML Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Acid Blood - \"Wartimes\" - Like this video?

Chávez on drums. Coming from a similar line to bands like Atheist and Cynic, Acrania manages to create death metaller environments with touches of Jazz, Samba, Bossa, Salsa and more, using a permanent lineup of vocals, guitars, bass, drums, percussion (congas, timbales, etc.), tenor saxophone and trumpet that result in this style to which they refer to as \"Latin Metal\". Their third album, \"Fearless\" is a definitive statement of intent from the band.\nThis album is once again a challenge to metal conventions and a testament to creativity and indifference to metal purists rules. \"Fearless\" was produced, recorded and mixed at Archway Studios in Mexico City by J.C. Chavez and Luis Oropeza, drummer and vocalist/guitarist respec- tively and was mastered in Tower Studio by Brett Caldas-Lima (Cynic, Megadeth). The cover artwork was again in charge of Berlin-based artist Eliran Kantor, well known for his work with bands like Testament, Iced Earth, Sodom and more.\nAcrania is also a band that does not hide it's political, religious and anthropological vision of the world in which we live in, I.E., in \"People of the Blaze\", the first single off of \"Fearless\", vocalist Luis Oropeza states that the track refers us to the \"crushing of Mexican culture at the time of the conquest, its sacrifices, its pyramidal vision of society and its hegemony\". \nReleased thanks to the support of Mexico’s National Council for Culture and Arts (CONACULTA) and the National Fund for Culture and Arts (FONCA) who saw in Acrania a musical product worthy of support, \"Fearless\" is the band's finest offering so far.\nThe band was formed in Mexico City in 2006, although their first studio EP, \"In Peaceful Chaos\", was recorded and released until 2007, this due to a personal and musical growth together between members who sought the perfect balance between Latin Jazz and Metal.\nAcrania proudly endorses Aquarian Drumheads, Cympad®, Westone & Rotosound Strings. \n\nDirector Name: Alberto Allende Montesinos\nProducer Name: Alberto Allende Montesinos\nAbout The Video:\nArtist Website: www.acrania.net\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/acraniaofficial\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/acraniaofficial\nMyspace: www.myspace.com/acrania            \nReverbNation: www.reverbnation.com/acrania          \nBandCamp: acraniaofficial.bandcamp.com\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/acraniaofficial\nOther:\n\nLabel Name: Self Released\nLabel Website: -----\n\nSong Lyrics:\nThere ́s only one brief story There ́s only one line\nWhy do you want to reach the limit This rope is getting too tight\nTolerance and compliance It ́s a matter of perspective You always want to be above I can not, I don ́t know\nVerse\nWhy?!\nI ́m asking\nWhy?!

They comprise of Drew Kohler on lead vocals and guitar, Shawn Weers on bass and vocals, and Daniel Richardson on drums. The band started in late 2012 in various apartments in the Midwest. \n The name came from the countless noise complaints they would receive from having band practice too loud on late nights and the surrounding neighbors would have to call the police to shut it down. One officer said \"You guys need to quit Waking the Neighbors if you want to continue living here.\" It stuck, and the party never stopped for the \"Neighborhood\" their loyal fanbase.\n \nAbout The Video: \"Brushed Aside\" is about a person who is a hopless romantic and no matter what has always ended up on the wrong end when it comes to relationships. These relationships had either been toxic or ended from cheating and lies and this person felt like they were always 'brushed aside' like an old painting that's decaying and covered in dust. Until, finally they meet and kiss their one true soulmate and everything was worth it in the end.\n\nThe video centers around a band serenading an artist as she paints a large canvas.\n \nDirector Name: Wabi.

The band brings heavy influence from the Ramones inspired punk rock of 90's Lookout! and Mutant Pop Records era, with the attitude of bands like Screeching Weasel & The Queers, Descendents & the melody and fun of 1950'/1960's pop and vocal bands. The band has released 3 full length albums, several splits and 7\" records on various labels and have toured throughout many parts of the USA.

The song tells the story of a series of \"Trials\" where the drug is being tested on children to see the effects it might have in giving them enhanced super abilities. As the children are now grown adults and some have unexplained abilities and are unaware of the Trials they endured as children, some are looking for answers as to what is causing, these some times terrifying alterations to their mental and physical states.\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheProzacs/\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/theprozacs\nBandCamp: https://theprozacs.bandcamp.com\n \nLabel Name: Outloud!

Captivated by the Arts from the early age of five, Lj began singing, taking dance and acting classes. His skill and talent developed over the years fueled by taking ballet. During his admittance into the Ballet Hispanico Dance Company, he was able to master the arts, even more, enjoying every moment.\nHe embraced every opportunity to develop and diversify his love for arts within the entertainment field. This was a wonderful time for Lj. His family later moved to West Palm Beach, Florida. In 1997 Lj attended Palm Beach Lakes High school where he vigorously continued to study Acting. He excelled as an Actor both on stage and in front of the Camera using Sanford Meisner’s master technique. In addition, he continued his study of dance and in his senior year he had the chance to perform for the Florida Stage company in the product Gunplay”. LJ later attended Keiser college in the study of computer graphic designing and imaging, between college he was working on starting his music career as a vocalist and songwriter following college he began concentrating on his skills performing professionally at large venues with local artists at various nightclubs throughout the United States and Canada. He is currently in the process of writing and producing his own music with an eye toward much success within the mainstream of the Music industry.\nWith his 90’s and millennium R&B moves and his braided hair vibe, LJ Ugarte's debut single, wore its old school on its sleeve. In the course of two singles, LJ has vaulted from wanting to re-create the mood of a vintage soul to wanting to make his own combination of Maxwell and Eric Benet These two singles mark the return of the retro-soul movement that began taking shape several years ago.\nLJ is aiming to return the soul to a headier, more opulent era. Some new Hip Hop and R&B artist revel in a sometimes brazen, sometimes vulgar fusion of hip-hop and old-school-soul pleading.\n \nDirector Name: Shadow\nProducer Name: Demo Dennard, LJ Ugarte\n \nAbout the Video: \"Feeling the Music\" *\nFirecreek Entertainment LLC\nLJ Ugarte/Aqua GT (BMI) \nETRAGU FIRE MUSIC Publishings (ASCAP)\nCopyright (c) 2017 ASCAP\n \nArtist Website: http://artistecard.com/Ljugarte\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Lj.ugarte.music/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Ljugarte\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8h8UwrhUnI\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lj-ugarte/feeling-the-music-produced-by-aqua\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/ljugarte\nTumblr: http://ljugarte.tumblr.com/\nOther Link: http://us.napster.com/artist/lj-ugarte\n \nLabel Name: Firecreek Entertainment/Pinkk records \nLabel Website: https://www.firecreekentertainment.com/\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xiiujBjRz5g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xiiujBjRz5g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xiiujBjRz5g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xiiujBjRz5g/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xiiujBjRz5g/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":907,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xiiujBjRz5g"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/L3MLE2jQQg4c6uu-PNdWn1OW6T4\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnNIZEd6U1ljVlRn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-09T02:03:22.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Short Stories - \"Serendipity\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Short Stories - \"Serendipity\" - Like this video?

The songs are simple yet full of hooks and bits of ear candy. The Virginia-based trio is a bit of minor “super group”, with each member coming in from other well established acts.\n\nThe music features upbeat, hopeful lyrics and simple story telling and is complemented by a minimalistic production technique as well as rustic, soothing acoustic instrumentation accented by sparing use of synths. Millennials may hear bits of Death Cab for Cutie and Wilco while those with a longer listening history may be reminded of Joe Jackson and Marshall Crenshaw.\n \nDirector Name: Kevin Adkins\nDirector Link: http://www.franklingotham.com/\nProducer Name: Robert Higgs\nProducer Link: http://www.franklingotham.com/\n \nAbout The Video: Filmed at Ft.

The dynamic combination of brutal shouts and growls with the extraordinary clean voice of lead vocalist Ro Seven lends the band unmistakable character.\n\nThe debut album 'Broken But Not Torn' was released in 2017. An impressive music video was released for the single '' Is She Worth It? ''.\n\nSinger Ro, the guitarists Alex and Billy, Drummer Niko and bassist Dani convince through energetic and thrilling live shows.\n \nDirector Name: David Grosser\nDirector Link: http://www.dg-media.com\nProducer Name: Robert Spandl\nProducer Link: http://www.teor.de\n \nAbout The Video: \"Is She Worth It?\" is a classic women’s drama story within a young band. The lyrics are entirely based on true experiences. It was, so to speak, a kind of “Yokko Ono” case within the band. In the early days of the band, when first small successes were recorded, there was a woman who was initially the girlfriend of the singer Ro Seven. She had, however, apparently found pleasure in putting the band members against each other. Since she had no success with Ro, she approached the drummer of the band. She brought him up against the other band members through hate and intrigue. In the band there were two clans and an unbearably bad mood prevailed. The band then collapsed. It took a year and a half until the band started again from scratch.\n\nAt the technical level, the video was shot in full HD by a video company. It took two shooting days and about one week post production. Three professional cameras were used and it was made in a storage hall of a local event production company.\n \nArtist Website: http://www.the-edge-of-reason.de\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheEdgeOfReason\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TEOROfficial\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheEdgeOfReasonTEOR\nOther Link: https://open.spotify.com/user/rspandl/playlist/6mjYARDjfLBriYaOX3fMzi\n \n \nSong Lyrics: I thought you are a friend. But I was assassinated by your naivete.\nCold fingers touched my heart. Then our family turned into a tragedy.\nDo you think, you’re the winner of this match? Oh god, why do you permit such a treason.\nI trusted you till the edge. Tell me a reason?\n\nYou don’t have to justify!\nYou’re not in the right.\nIt was like:\n\nWhen you murdered a civilian for a bitch.\nIs she worth it? Is she worth it?\nCross your s*x drive and build a bridge! Stupid bitch!\nShe’s not worth it! She’s not worth it!\n\nI can’t look in your eyes any longer. You give me an urge to gag.\nYou’re nothing but a sponger. You’re just a leaf … in the wind.\nThe blindness is your overlord. My tears are frozen.\nYour cold breath is a sword. It’s killing me a dozen .. times.\n\nYou don’t have to justify!\nYou’re not in the right.\nIt was like:\n\nWhen you murdered a civilian for a bitch.\nIs she worth it? Is she worth it?\nCross your s*x drive and build a bridge! Stupid bitch!\nShe’s not worth it! She’s not worth it!\n\nBros before hoes\nBros before hoes\nBros before hoes\n\nBut if the way is the only destination,\nThen I am ready to forgive.\nI hope you see this song as a reflection.\nAnd then change the way you live.\n\nfor a bitch. Is she worth it? Is she worth it?\nCross your s*x drive and build a bridge! Stupid bitch!\nShe’s not worth it! She’s not worth it!\nWhen you murdered a civilian for a bitch.\nIs she worth it? Is she worth it?\nCross your s*x drive and build a bridge! Stupid bitch!\nShe’s not worth it! She’s not worth it!\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OhMaLDkmYUk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OhMaLDkmYUk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OhMaLDkmYUk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OhMaLDkmYUk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OhMaLDkmYUk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":914,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"OhMaLDkmYUk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/VRg_oJJM-BDPoTpI1K8BDQnrMz8\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnllUG81eTI0NFZF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-06T06:57:10.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Acid Blood - \"Dagger Eyes\" JanML Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Acid Blood - \"Dagger Eyes\" - Like this video?

With vocals sounding like a howling wolf but at the same time so delicate, with old guitars and a rutted bass that are all dancing on the prehistoric sounds of the stubborn drummer, THI was born in a basement... Blues rock, garage rock,...\n\nAfter their first record 'Road to Woodstock', recorded and produced by the wizard Niels 'Fons' Hendrix, THI dived into the GAM Studios led by Guru Jan Viggria and 'In the Lion's Den' is set for release on October 26, 2017! \n\nUpcoming showdates:\n18-08 Klappoel – Borgloon\n25-08 Heidefeesten – Genk\n26-08 The Roots – Bilzen (BE)\n14-10 Limbomania - Herk-de-Stad (BE)\n24-10 Durango Sessions – Radio Benelux\n26-10 EP RELEASE – Café Café Hasselt (BE)\n \nDirector Name: Wouter Van Der Schueren\n \nAbout the Video: It's about an average Joe losing grip on reality caused by the blistering sun. He's looking for water in his house, but can't find any. When he does he notices that his mouth has been sewn shut and can't drink no more. He therefore tries to intubate bottles of water, but is blocked by the demons of society.\n\nMaking of the Video: Shot in a abandoned squat in Genk (BE) which we further (totally) trashed. The demons are the members of The Hourglass Instinct.\n \nArtist Website: http://www.thehourglassinstinct.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/The-Hourglass-Instinct-212518148846318\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Hourglass_Inst_\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXEGzkF01Qz_bWFkX1bfeCA\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/the-hourglass-instinct\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/artist/thehourglassinstinct\nOther Link: https://vimeo.com/227602887\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jS_2kO4aq30/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jS_2kO4aq30/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jS_2kO4aq30/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jS_2kO4aq30/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jS_2kO4aq30/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":917,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jS_2kO4aq30"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/vHMJn-Ilreu10L25f8NWtozMPgI\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmpJTjRoanJ4aGRR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-06T03:09:12.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Ice Balloons - \"Fallen Family\" Volar Records","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Ice Balloons - \"Fallen Family\" - Like this video?

Trainor’s stark, choppy animation, initially all hand-drawn cells painstakingly traced with sharpies, dives into an enigmatic worldly familial symbolism with mysterious wryness.\n\nThe song itself is about failed Christmas gathering where family goodwill has been entirely replaced.\n\nFrom the minds of mischief makers, no-wave, noise-punk band Ice Balloons - Kyp Malone (TV on the Radio), Sean Kennerly (Samiam), Sean Powell (Fuckemos, Surfbort), Giselle Reiber (Midnight Masses), Dan Scinta (Wild Yaks) and BA Miale.\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/IceBalloons/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IceBalloons\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqIyJriJhfQtdF3x5xTsXw\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/volar-records/ice-balloons-the-wasp-fiesta\nBandCamp: https://iceballoons.bandcamp.com/\n \nLabel Name: Volar Records\nLabel Website: http://www.volarrecords.com/\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jIN4hjrxhdQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jIN4hjrxhdQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jIN4hjrxhdQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jIN4hjrxhdQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jIN4hjrxhdQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":918,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jIN4hjrxhdQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/zRpgSouLV9LO8Q5TQFX-RZfS2PI\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmZvUDY5Q1VZSl9z","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-06T04:15:19.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The Vale. - \"Voiceless\" (Instrumental) - Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - The Vale. - \"Voiceless\" - Like this video?

You can keep it, I may have your blood but you are no part of what I've become, you'll probably never know your son\n\nWhat is the colour of this sadness, words can't put it into perspective, I may have not been the perfect son, but what do you expect with no guidance,\nThere's something missing \nwhy is there always something missing?

Oftentimes these weighty discussions end at an impasse, each side so confident in the rightness of their held position that there is no change. Every once in a while, however, a new perspective on an old belief is born not through entrenched rhetoric, but candid questions. We’ve all heard it, maybe you even said it yourself: “hm, that’s a good question.” Paperhaus don’t have the answers, hell, they’re still looking for the right questions. And that sense of seeking propels their new record—Are These The Questions We Need To Ask?, out Fall 2017 on Pittsburgh’s Misra Records (Destroyer, Phosphorescent, Great Lake Swimmers)—forward, while much of the world is left looking at the past.\n\nFounded in 2006 by Alex Tebeleff (Black Lodge) along with childhood friends Eddie Rivers and Jeff Galfond, and fleshed out by various collaborators over the years—on ATTQWNTA?, Tebeleff has continued the project and is joined by new writing partners Matt Dowling (Deleted Scenes, The Effects, Joy Buttons) and Rick Irby (Den-Mate, Wanted Man, Jau Ocean)—Paperhaus functions as both a band and a creative collective, the latter in the form of their famed house venue (infamously featured on the pilot of HGTV’s DC Flippers). After a tense election season and the loss of a central collaborator to the sun of Los Angeles, Tebeleff felt it was time to change up the project's approach. A steady diet of modular synthesizers, community organizing and collaborative experimentation with aforementioned players emboldened his resolve to ride Paperhaus to its inevitable next stage.\n\nAnd here we are: now. ATTQWNTA? marks a turning point for Paperhaus. Through a wide palate of psych, kraut, classic pop and noise Paperhaus rips through eight exciting new tracks, each paying service to the album’s whole. The current ensemble shines most on new songs like “Told You What To Say,” “Go Cozy,” and “Walk Through The Woods,” where some of the band’s heaviest guitars mix with a potent, mechanical rhythm section and Tebeleff’s Moog Sub 37, on which many of these compositions were first conceived. The lyrics—penned by Tebeleff and Dowling—reflect the band’s newly matured worldview, infusing their long-held commitment to community with a sense of wide-eyed awe. Settling into a series of studios over the last two years, the final recorded product was expertly engineered & mixed by Peter Larkin of The Lighthouse Recording Studio in Alexandria, VA. All things considered, ATTQWNTA? shows a new band ready to lead their peers out onto the next branch. They haven’t forgotten where they came from, but instead, they’re forging ahead, despite the anxiety of the unknown.\n\n- Peter Lillis\n\n\"Are These The Questions That We Need To Ask?\" out 10/6 on Misra Records.\n \nDirector Name: Emre Yagci\n \nAbout the Video: So the short story on \"Go Cozy\" is it's a song about friendship and community. Alex felt inspired in the lyrics by the camaraderie felt in the DC music scene. \n\n\nArtist Website: http://www.paperhausmusic.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Paperhausmusic\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/paperhausmusic\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/paperhausmusic\nLastFM: https://www.last.fm/music/Paperhaus\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/paperhausmusic\nBandCamp: https://paperhaus.bandcamp.com/\n \nLabel Name: Misra Records\nLabel Website: https://www.misrarecords.com/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/teFjqknG9zg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/teFjqknG9zg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/teFjqknG9zg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/teFjqknG9zg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/teFjqknG9zg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":923,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"teFjqknG9zg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Mp46CW4zEHF-oEdpmO7eHkzs1mA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnFtMTFYVTZuUkE0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-02T04:35:00.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Illumenium - \"My Own Way\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Illumenium - \"My Own Way\" - Like this video?

After losing his grandfather, both parents to terminal illness and one of his best friends due to an overdose all within three-year period, he found comfort and escape through music.\n\nKaspa released his first album 'Found My Way' in 2014 which was a journey into his personal story that shaped his own life. You experience loss, struggles, and everything in-between which received online radio buzz and began building his fanbase. Dedicated and persistent to his craft he doubled down and started to work on his latest album “Everything I Am” released on April 25, 2017. Kaspa puts exceptional story telling abilities expressed on every song. No Filler, No Fabrication, No Ego, and No Bullshit.\n \nDirector Name: Sean H Mitchell\nDirector Link: https://vimeo.com/seanhmitchell\nProducer Name: Sean H Mitchell\nProducer Link: https://vimeo.com/seanhmitchell\n \nArtist Website: https://www.kaspahiphop.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/kaspahiphop/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/kaspahiphop\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/kaspahiphop\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/kaspahiphop\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/kaspahiphop\nBandCamp: https://kaspa.bandcamp.com/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kaspa666/\n\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NYZi_OoW4wU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NYZi_OoW4wU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NYZi_OoW4wU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NYZi_OoW4wU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NYZi_OoW4wU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":928,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NYZi_OoW4wU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/jsR5xbA5hVuRYuP6TuzEGbXrJDU\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmN0NW5EU1R3LWlB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-30T05:54:17.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Neu Yeuth - \"Make a Move\" Freakout Records - A BlankTV Feature!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Neu Yeuth - \"Make a Move\" - Like this video?

They pull inspiration from the dead of night, writing in their studio that is illuminated by just a neon glow. Their comprehensive lyrics reveal the truths within reminiscing about the carefree nights in your adolescent years to uncovering the darkness of our future that we have yet to discover, and everything in between.\nFloating on a bed of light synths and melodies, the duo provides an illuminating sound that brings the lucid dreams of youth to life.\n\nWith influences such as Grimes, Purity Ring, and CHVRCHES, this summer, Neu Yeuth will carry the digital sounds from across the sea to the Pacific Northwest with their debut self-titled EP, out now on Freakout Records.\n \nDirector Name: Andrew Imanaka\nProducer Name: Boneshack Studio\n \nAbout The Video: Written by Neu Yeuth\nProduced by Neu Yeuth and Boneshack Studio\nMastered by Christian Burton\n\nCreated by Huntington Filson and Claire Grayson\nDirected and Edited by Andrew Imanaka\nShot by Ryan Davis and Andrew Imanaka\n \nArtist Website: http://neuyeuth.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NeuYeuth/\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/neuyeuth\nBandCamp: https://freakoutrec.bandcamp.com/album/neu-yeuth-neu-yeuth-ep\n \nLabel Name: Freakout Records\nLabel Website: http://www.freakoutrec.com/\n \nSong Lyrics: MAKE A MOVE\nI’ve never been here before\nI’ve never had a reason not to self destruct, self-sabotage\nYou’re an anomaly, I think\nI’m in danger here, I think\nI’m a stranger here,\nOh I feel strange\n\nWhy won’t you make a move\nDid somebody burn you\nDid somebody leave a sour taste in your heart?\nWhy won’t you come closer\nDid somebody twist you up inside\nIs there a knife in your chest?\nLet’s be reckless\n\nI’m so lost here\nBut I can’t just let it go\nI can’t let you go\nWe’re so compatible\nI’m so lost here\nWhat if you’re the only one\nWho can take this smoking gun out of my hands\nI don’t want to use it\nBut I may lose it.\n\nWhy won’t you make a move\nDid somebody burn you\nDid somebody leave a sour taste in your heart?\nWhy won’t you come closer\nDid somebody twist you up inside\nIs there a knife in your chest?\nLet’s be reckless\n\nMaybe I can help, maybe if you lay here a while\nMaybe you will melt, or maybe you will break a little more\nMaybe I can help, maybe if you lay here a while\nMaybe you will melt, or maybe you will break a little more\nAnd so I’ll break a little more\n\nWhy won’t you make a move\nDid somebody burn you\nDid somebody leave a sour taste in your heart?\nWhy won’t you come closer\nDid somebody twist you up inside\nIs there a knife in your chest?\nLet’s be reckless\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ct5nDSTw-iA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ct5nDSTw-iA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ct5nDSTw-iA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ct5nDSTw-iA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ct5nDSTw-iA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":929,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ct5nDSTw-iA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/daQ6O6PI_hy-nT0YGKHWO3fVX5Q\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjBkdjVxYktqSlpN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-28T23:34:40.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Flowtone - The Making of 'Fallen Temples' - A BlankTV Feature!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Flowtone - The Making of 'Fallen Temples' - Like this video?

A little morbid but also comical and relevant.\n\nFrom two-part vocal harmonies to worldly-inspired guitar solos, our band blends and weaves melodies, telling a story in our playing. The strong rhythm section complements each of our aggressive nature and at times, we will surprise you with our synchronicity.\n \nAbout The Video: Get a behind the scenes look at the process of recording Flowtone's second album, Fallen Temples. Through a series of interviews, in studio moments, and clips of their live performance, you can see the challenges and successes that came from this process. The video was filmed in Chicago over the course of 3 months, while the band was rehearsing, during the studio sessions, and at their first show back. Fallen Temples is set to release in October of 2017 and the first single 'Fool That I Am' is being offered for free on their website. \n \nProducer Name: Mac Yellek \nProducer Link: http://www.yellekmedia.com/audio/\n \nArtist Website: http://gowiththeflowtone.com/\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/flowtone\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/flowtoneAF\nYouTube: http://youtube.com/flowtone336\nSoundCloud: http://soundcloud.com/flowtone336\nOther Link: http://instagram.com/flow.tone \n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0dv5qbKjJZM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0dv5qbKjJZM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0dv5qbKjJZM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0dv5qbKjJZM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0dv5qbKjJZM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":930,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"0dv5qbKjJZM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/lXpslADtpFclv_LDFp83_dI0Wis\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Ll90MklzQ3pEa2Y0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-30T01:36:12.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Minerva - \"Grítalo al Viente\" Official Lyric Video","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Minerva - \"Grítalo al Viente\" - Like this video?

As the leading man of a small collective entitled TeamFromNowhere (a team of creatives ranging from singers & poets to multimedia content creators), -topic has shared his story in multiple academic settings including TEDx, the Dallas Museum of Art, and presented performances alongside today's innovators of creative culture, such as Kendrick Lamar, Erykah Badu, and Thundercat (in collaboration with Red Bull Sound Select).\n\nOn top of that, he's the first artist in the city to receive a grant for facilitating his own shows and events, featuring local headliners with all original music.\nWith the most recent release of his feel-good freebie 'tape of the year, \"My Favorite Sweaters\", the talented up-and-comer continues the effort to carve a dynamic lane for himself on the path towards meriting his own unique audience. In 2011, he released his first self-produced album, \"Finally Confident\", independently. The following year, -topic released his \"Songs About P___y (S.A.P)\" EP, which featured the TeamFromNowhere collective aiding in what music appreciators nationwide consider to be the \"Perfect Valentines' Day Soundtrack, whether single, paired, or in an 'It's complicated', whatever that means.\" With the 2013 release of the 5-song \"Time to Feed the Birds: Stories of Dead Kings\" EP, -topic gained the ears of both Erykah Badu and Lupe Fiasco, with Erykah Badu paying $100 for the $5 EP. \n\n-topic's latest self-produced album \"Be Good & Do Well\", was co-signed by rap icons Yassin Bey (Mos Def) and GZA of Wu-Tang Clan: \"My heroes were all starting to listen. The people I looked up to began to see that I really had something to say.\"\nFast forward to the present day, -topic is a nationally recognized Red Bull Sound Select artist, and has begun work on his third studio album, aptly titled \"These Things Will Happen\". Now partnering citywide with Dallas' premiere instrumentalists and vocal performers alike, -topic finds his unconventional yet familiar sound ranked among critically acclaimed artists such as Leon Bridges, Polyphonic Spree, T.D.E., Big K.R.I.T., and Hiatus Kaiyote. \n \nDirector Name: Edward Chalupa\nDirector Link: http://www.chalupaproductions.com\nProducer Name: Edward Chalupa\nProducer Link: http://www.chalupaproductions.com\n \nAbout The Video: It all started when I contacted him about doing a music video and he said that he was looking to promote his Favorite Sweaters album. During the initial pitch, I asked him - “Ok, I have two music video concepts that I think we could work with. One is a really sleek modern and stylized concept, and the other is a weird abstract that is a bit goofy.” Topic then proceeded to tell me how he likes weird ideas and encouraged the creativity to do something unique. Over the course of a week I worked on the treatment, outline, and script. During that time I secured locations to shoot at Kholes, Shenanigans, and Lindsey Park. After that, we wrapped at the Adam Hats lofts where we all climbed the water tower to talk about what it means to be an artist in Dallas and why it is important to be interesting. \n\nHe we are today with the end result of weeks of preparation, a day of shooting, and a week of editing.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sosotopic/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sosotopic\nBandCamp: https://topic.bandcamp.com\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/topic\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T-N7cYOqlAM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T-N7cYOqlAM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T-N7cYOqlAM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T-N7cYOqlAM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T-N7cYOqlAM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":935,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"T-N7cYOqlAM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ggg_4Wb0o_c6t921sEiJFL51wUg\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LkwxTG0wQVc2YU4w","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-29T03:51:31.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"80I - \"Arbe\" Official Teaser Video","description":"http://www.DankTV.com - 80I - \"Arbe\" - Like this video?

Myka 9 has said of his style: \"My rhymes take the direction of a jazz trumpet or sax solo, like Miles or Trane, if I was to rhyme in the same meter as those notes... that's my concept.\" \n\nMyka 9 is featured in the documentary 'Freestyle: The Art of Rhyme'. He is also featured in the award-winning documentary “This Is the Life”, chronicling the music movement that was birthed at The Good Life Cafe in South Central, Los Angeles. The Good Life Cafe is the open-mic workshop where he first performed with Freestyle Fellowship in the early 1990s.\n \nDirector Name: Kelvin Kurasaki\nProducer Name: Freematik\nProducer Link: https://freematik.bandcamp.com\n \nAbout The Video: This song is from an album called 'Teleported' which is a collaboration between Los Angeles hip-hop legend Myka 9 and Bay Area producer and motion comic creator Freematik. The concept was an album that was partially a soundtrack for the Dark Moon motion comic universe, and also explored other sci-fi concepts, in addition to being a classic hip-hop experience at it’s core.\n\nThe video features a Myka 9 green screen performance effected in various ways to add a psychedelic sci-fi element to the video. Myka 9 recorded his performance in front of a green screen so that we could experiment with effects in many different ways, and the result is a fresh experience to suit the unique music. \n \nArtist Website: http://myka9.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Myka9/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/myka9\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/myka9\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/knownshadows\nBandCamp: https://knownshadows.bandcamp.com\n \nLabel Name: Known Shadows\nLabel Website: https://knownshadows.bandcamp.com\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jty9q-iaoPg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jty9q-iaoPg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jty9q-iaoPg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jty9q-iaoPg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jty9q-iaoPg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":939,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jty9q-iaoPg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/xSWa7QGr0nH9CJujhQZRqRrjHOM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjB3MTkwV29tVk1J","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-25T05:08:18.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"For the Glory - \"When the Time Comes\" Rastilho Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - For the Glory - \"When the Time Comes\" - Like this video?

They quickly became known for their catchy rhythms and heartfelt lyrics paired with their high-energy interactive live performances. In no time Goodbye Old Friend has quickly become a crowd favorite in the Siouxland area.

So many people live day to day working jobs that suck the life out of them simply because they feel their dreams are unrealistic. We urge people to stop calling their dreams, dreams and start calling them goals. You are the only one holding yourself back from what you truly want to do with your life. Doubt and fear kill more dreams than failure ever will. So don't let others tell you what you can and can't do. Take control. Work at it everyday and watch your dreams blossom into a reality.\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/goodbyeoldfriend/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUQGjkmgvF9dkIg9UkIs8kQ\nBandCamp: https://goodbyeoldfriend.bandcamp.com/album/goodbye-old-friend\n \n \nSong Lyrics: So does it make you feel so much stronger, knowing that I don't have a chance to stand. Looking up at a coward’s excuse for a man, you are the reason that I…\n\nKeep standing, to show that I still have fight left in me.\n(Rise)\nI won’t let you have this so easily, you won’t be the end of me.\n(You won’t be the end of me.)\n\nI’m so tired of the disappointment that is placed on me. By the empty people in my life who surround me; and it’s tearing apart everything I thought I had left in me, leaving me a hollowed empty shell, the forgotten me.\n\nIt's the power that you hold over my head, that’s caused by my lack of strength. I don’t believe in myself anymore, I lack the power to accept my life.\n\nI tell myself everyday that I’m not the man in the mirror, no roads are paved, I can set the way.\nBe who I want to be.\n\nI’m so tired of the disappointment that is placed on me. By the empty people in my life who surround me; and it’s tearing apart everything I thought I had left in me, leaving me a hollowed empty shell, the forgotten me.\n\nThe pain of neglect, the fear of regret. I'm trying my damnedest to live and forget. The hate inside me the struggle to breath, I'm trying to feel something but have no reprieve. The life of roulette; The score has been set in the hands of the strong, your life is the debt. In the end we all feel the shame. You decide how to handle the pain\n(2X)\n(Finish the game that you call a life. The empty space that fills inside will keep you alive)\n\nThis is my last and final words of advice; To leave your mark before they take your life.\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rek-pc4tUv0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rek-pc4tUv0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rek-pc4tUv0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rek-pc4tUv0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rek-pc4tUv0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":965,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rek-pc4tUv0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/QiF4_mWsl-cxcnWKw4hL7mjzPMI\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjNscFZRelZIdHBV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-23T21:12:09.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Dead 77 - \"Take Me Away\" Evacuate Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Dead 77 - \"Take Me Away\" - Like this video?

KrankTV.com!\n \n***\nDevillians - \"Never Back Down\" Official Lyric Video - Honor Record\n \nArtist city, country: Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia\n \nArtist Biography: Built upon the solid bedrock of metalcore, Devillians, the five piece band based in the underbellies of KL now returns to bring you four new nightmarish terror-ridden tracks from their new EP, 'Existence'.\n\nHaving been founded in 2007 by Firdaus who until now holds the helm as the lead guitarist, the band had undergone several changes in their line-up. Where it had made regular appearances in underground shows in and about KL, the band had gone into a hiatus in order to scout for members who could carry the weight of the band concurrently concocting their EP, Existence. At present, Devillians is manned by Firdaus as stated, Izzat on drums, Danial on rhythm guitar, Ezmeel on Bass and Ali on vocals. \n\nTheir style of music draws influence and ranges from the ungodly death howls of Randy Blythe and quick paced sure-fire guitar picking style of Lamb of God, to the heavy, rhythmic, progressive chord patterning of the Darkest Hour and machine gun kicks of that of August Burns Red. The band sound has been said to be reminiscent of As I Lay Dying, In Flames, Unearth, August Burns Red and Summer's End, to name a few. \n\nWith their new EP, the band is ready to take on Kuala Lumpur's underground scene and spread their name throughout the whole country and introduce \"Devillians\" to the world.\n\n\n.DEVILLIANS RELEASED THEIR FIRST EP \"EXISTENCE\".\n\nExistence, a result of research, planning and practice over the years of the band’s existence. With their new EP, Devillians now re-emerges from the depths of obscurity into the forefront of metal carnage.\n\nComing from different styles of musical influences, blended together in a mesh of metalcore goodness, Devillians’ new EP, Existence, marks a new start in the band’s agenda and ambition.\n\nThe EP has 4 monstrous track, all written and performed by the band itself except for the back up vocals in the chorus part of the song \"The Rodeo\" which was done by Ardy from the band Naratu. Also, all 4 tracks in the EP were recorded, mixed, and mastered by Ardy (Naratu/NuBreax). Kicking it off with \"The Rodeo\" as the first track, this energetic super hype tune serves as an invitation to the listeners to \"open your arms and embrace\" (quoting the lyrics from the song itself). The second track has actually had been pre-released as single on YouTube with the title \"Never Back Down\". They released the song's lyric video and it instantly shared and spread throughout the local community. The song is about life principle, it's about fighting for yourself, its about fighting for what you deserve and not giving up. The third song \"Existence\", is pretty straight forward. It has catchy riffs with groovy breakdowns and strong vocals. The last track is quite special and it carries a different vibe compared with the rest of the songs. Its a tribute song for the victims and families of the MH370 and MH17 tragedies. These horrible nightmarish incidents had taken the whole nation by surprised and everybody are upset. The band wanted to show their support and prayers so they wrote this lamentation to share with the whole world.\n\nIn the near future, Devillians has gigs planned which pans across Malaysia notably in KL where the band will hold its EP launch party. The band will be participating with Thy Regiment \"Iron Heart\" Album tour where they'll be playing at 3 different venues (Ipoh, Penang and Nilai). The band is also set to take to the stage for Musica Mania Launch Festival which will be held at Atas, Kelana Jaya, playing alongside local big names such as Naratu, Thy Regiment, Upon Arrival, Against Infinity and others. They are ready to bring metal rampage to the pit and to meet its friends and families head on as they traverse into the world of metal. \n \nProducer Name: Honor Record\n \nAbout The Video: Lyric Video for the song \"Never Back Down\" taken from the EP \"Existence\" from the band Devillians. The song is about life principle, it's about fighting for yourself, its about fighting for what you deserve and not giving up.\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/devillians.my/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevilliansMY?lang=en-my\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp2t-KZpxP4\nOther Link: https://www.instagram.com/devillians/\n \nLabel Name: Honor Record\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9G_cGJ4Xrc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9G_cGJ4Xrc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9G_cGJ4Xrc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9G_cGJ4Xrc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9G_cGJ4Xrc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":968,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"H9G_cGJ4Xrc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/I_5TfAPaBFMmcAiWdbrfhfKn-cc\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnR1dlVzZDQwcDI4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-23T07:22:41.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Negative Sky - \"The Dark Unknown\" Zenergy Entertainment Group","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Negative Sky - \"The Dark Unknown\" - Like this video?

Utilizing a diverse mixture of heavy groove, technicality, melody, and attitude, they make the kind of music that immediately sets them apart from their peers. They defy boundaries, and leave lasting impressions distinguishing them as a one-of-a-kind hybrid of the various genres they experiment with. The key to their style is innovation, and amplifying the instinctive “feel good” sounds that trigger something within each and every one of us.\n\nIn 2013, the guys began work on new material. After demo-ing a large number of songs that had come together, the band settled on five songs to take into the studio, which would become an EP entitled Death of the Sun. The title track and the song \"Disasteroid,\" both did well with radio and the latter has become a fan favorite and pit anthem. \nThe success of Negative Sky has been picking up steam like a runaway freight train and it shows no signs of slowing down.\n \nDirector Name: Tom Monahan\nDirector Link: http://www.facebook.com/EmpireCreative\nProducer Name: Zenergy Entertainment Group\nProducer Link: http://www.zenergyonline.com/\n \nAbout The Video: The video contains live footage shot at the Stone Pony when the band played with the Deftones.

After an initial period of setting in, during which they also passed through some tough moments, the band finally finds its own way, paradoxically an amount of the different previous musical experiences of each member of the group. \nPunk sounds and melodies find their natural fulfillment in metal’s speeds and variations and, in addiction, a clean, clear, pop voice makes its way.\nThe result of this genre-mixing is The Morning Is for Sleeping’s first music: under the cover of an ironic moniker we find a melodic post-hardcore/punk sound where cruelty meets melody, not leaving out inspiration and fantasy but always with an eye to metalcore.\nIn May, 2012 Marco, Alessio, Ilian, Jacopo e Marco started the recording of their first homonymous EP. Seven tracks that tell us the band’s exponential growth and describe The Morning Is for Sleeping project at their best.\nThe Morning Is For Sleeping’s EP was recorded analogically in Kick Recording Studio (guitars and bass) and in Matteo Gabbianelli’s Kutso Noise Home (drums, voice and mastering). It was released on \nNovember 10, 2012 on the band’s website, reaching over 1.000 downloads thanks to self-promo activities.\nAfter a short Russian tour in March 2014, the band signed to This Is Core Records (Italy) which allowed them to republish the first EP with the addition of a new single, Halfway Home.\nSo the band began writing new material, like Graves Of Despise, a new single released in 2015 with a DIY video.\nIn 2016, after hard personal heels and a line up change, the band began recording the first full length album with Marco Mastrobuono (Hour Of Penance) at Kick Recording Studio.\nIn Truth And Lies came out in the music stores and streaming platforms on May 19, 2017, always for This Is Core Records, revealed by the single \"Hollywood\". \n \nDirector Name: Lucerna Films\nDirector Link: http://lucernafilms.com/\nProducer Name: Lucerna Films\nProducer Link: http://lucernafilms.com/\n \nAbout The Video: \"Hollywood\" is the single that anticipates ‘In Truth and Lies’, The Morning Is for Sleeping’s brand new album that will be released in may 2017. It’s a song about all the difficulties that people meet when they decide to leave simple but illusionary life situations, preferring the hard impact with a reality that appear to be difficult. Because everyone wants to get out from their little Hollywood.\n \nArtist Website: http://www.themorningisforsleeping.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/tmifs\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/TMI4S\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdYMUvcpifNMbqsthHAr5bw\n \nLabel Name: This Is Core\nLabel Website: https://www.thisiscore.net/\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHk4m4SEBvk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHk4m4SEBvk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHk4m4SEBvk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHk4m4SEBvk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHk4m4SEBvk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":975,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"mHk4m4SEBvk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/LFLrYZq-ZCuDkOhyubnblWW5rMY\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk9vMGJGdkRlVHZR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-17T13:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Going Home in a Body Bag - \"Stick to Your Path\" A BlankTV Feature!","description":"http://www.KrankTV.com - Going Home in a Body Bag - \"Stick to Your Path\" - Like this video?

Produced by Buffalo Killers' Zachary Gabbard, this six-track effort, entitled Communion, is the band’s first release since their 2015 debut album, Diamonds (produced by Grammy Award recipient Brian Olive). The EP will also coincide with the release of a full-length film entitled “Where The Ocean Meets The Sky” that will feature behind-the-scenes footage and videos for all of the songs from Communion. \n\nDuring the lengthy recording process for the EP the band experienced a number of life changes, losses and new beginnings. The band replaced original drummer Jim Ingram with Kyle Sweney, two members of the band opened substantial new businesses and other members changed their careers and day-jobs and nearly everyone in the band experienced weird phenomena that ranged from sleep paralysis to possible contact with otherworldly life forms. “We all have had some bizarre dreams and weird lights coming in windows and shadowy figures looming in our dreams and things like that,” admitted Wells. “Sometimes we get freaked out by it but it’s kind of par for the course for this group. Everybody in the band had weird childhood experiences and experiences as adults that sort of ties us together. Sometimes we’re as much a support group for each other’s weird experiences as we are a band. That’s a little bit what the title of this EP is about. Communion is about coming together or being brought together and experiencing these life changing moments.” \n\nCricketbows' Communion will be available September 8th on CD, digital and streaming formats via Mosquito Hawk Records.\n \nDirector Name: Chad Wells\n \nAbout The Video: “This song is kind of what you might call bitter nostalgia. It’s pretty autobiographical but it’s going to resonate with anybody that grew up in a divorced family or who had to move around a whole bunch. It’s about what it felt like as a kid and how it colors the adult that you’ll become. Musically, I think the influences for this song come from a bunch of different places but I think my personal love of late ’70s and early ’80s Songwriter Rock, stuff like Billy Joel and Springsteen, gets mixed in with some of our late ’80s and early ’90s Alternative College Rock stuff like The Replacements, R.E.M. and Uncle Tupelo. It definitely betrays some of the time I spent playing in punk bands. I think Aarika called it our ‘Warped Tour Song’ when we first played it. The video for the song is mostly shot by our friend Josh Gwin at a few hometown shows and a festival, mixed in with old 8mm home movies.”\n-Chad Wells (Vocals, Guitar)\n \nArtist Website: http://www.cricketbows.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/cricketbows\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Cricketbows\nYouTube: https://twitter.com/Cricketbows\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/cricketbows\nBandCamp: https://cricketbows.bandcamp.com\n \nLabel Name: Mosquito Hawk Records\n \n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5s4hB5RedKw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5s4hB5RedKw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5s4hB5RedKw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5s4hB5RedKw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5s4hB5RedKw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":977,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"5s4hB5RedKw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/4GT_zPZ-Rx830fT8Qz3eI31pDLA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnJ3S1REb2I5ajhJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-20T07:04:32.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Inhalants - \"Bread Pitt\"  Live at Skatopia - 2017","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Inhalants - \"Bread Pitt\" - Like this video?

And Inhalants has been stealing hotel breakfasts ever since. \n\nAlso we have an LP coming out this summer called 'Ectorotica'.

They gave us the opportunity to play both nights and basically headline the second night. Never have I seen so much crazy shit and met such awesome people in such a short time.\n\nThe first night we all did LSD and hauled our gear down a huge muddy hill in the pouring rain, then played in that packed barn while the rain slammed on the roof, and people moshed as hard as they skated that bowl. \n\nDay two we were the soundtrack for exploding cars.\n\nI can now say that we've played the same stage as SHAT (My life has peaked!)\n \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/huffhuffinhalants\nBandCamp: https://huffhuffinhalants.bandcamp.com\n \n \nSong Lyrics: An iron giant struts in fishnet stockings for the horde;\na succubus in tights.\nThey're screaming for a place to rest\nI beg angst \"Keep me up all night, oh!\"\n\nTake a look, behold her dead wine, gold, and cold silk\nWhile my friends try to kill themselves,\nthey've been crying over having everything.\n\nHer breasts are the minimum wage;\nthey took the life from the eyes of the working man.\nHe sits alone at the end of the bar and he drinks.\nDo you see him?\nHe drinks so damn slow,\nfrom the glass of cold comfort\nthat's killing him so.\n\nSpit on me, girl\nPiss on me, girl\n\nBecause love doesn't come in someone else.\nEven if you come in someone else,\nLove doesn't come in someone else,\nIt comes in paper.\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rwKTDob9j8I/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rwKTDob9j8I/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rwKTDob9j8I/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rwKTDob9j8I/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rwKTDob9j8I/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":978,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rwKTDob9j8I"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/nyBt5j-oMQzBJREVY_RVwF90Zzs\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LlpXUFdXYWY1UDhv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-20T05:43:00.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Nino Helfrich - \"Your Own Way\" feat.

Björn Strid (Soilwork) - Official Music Video\n \nArtist city, country: Hamburg, Germany\n \nArtist Biography: Hockey goalies truly are a breed of their own. Being individuals in a team sport, they are often labeled as weird and quirky. A special nature that worked well for Nino Helfrich, not only in sports but also in music. After dropping the hockey stick and picking up the guitar, Nino Helfrich reached a high technical level, thus being self- taught playing only for five years.\n\nThe release of his debut album 'Dead Bodies In Motion' marked the beginning of his solo career in 2016. With his technical yet melodic instrumental music, he’s in good company having worked with US-based guitar virtuoso Angel Vivaldi. On his second album 'Hourglass' Helfrich worked with several guest-singers including Björn Strid of Soilwork, Chris Clancy of Mutiny Within and Wearing Scars, as well as Christoph Wieczorek of Annisokay.\n \nDirector Name: Nino Helfrich\nProducer Name: Nino Helfrich\n \nArtist Website: https://www.ninohelfrich.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/NinoHelfrich\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NinoHelfrich\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCATGFMevQWU69ZsJmzeMPhQ\nBandCamp: https://ninohelfrich.bandcamp.com/\nOther Link: http://www.cdbaby.com/ninohelfrich\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZWPWWaf5P8o/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZWPWWaf5P8o/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZWPWWaf5P8o/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZWPWWaf5P8o/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZWPWWaf5P8o/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":979,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ZWPWWaf5P8o"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/t5I36snwdFiSRr4YRBWg1K_mRPA\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lkt6ZVlYd1lYa1hB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-20T01:32:14.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"45 Adapters - \"You're Dying\" Pirate Press Records/Contra Punk/Longshot Music","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - 45 Adapters - \"You're Dying\" - Like this video?

Since then he's put out 17 albums, 2 E.P.s, and has been on countless compilations... and finally after years of searching M.A.T.B. is no longer a one man band... in the spring of 2016 Kyle Donnelly (Bass) and Paul LaCroix (drums) jumped on board. They released an e.p. and in the winter of 2016 they had a line up change and introduced nick latour into the band as the new drummer while paul moved to lead guitar. In the spring of 2017 kyle decided to leave the band, so paul has taken over on bass. They're releasing the new album \"Every Path\" in the fall of 2017\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MarkoandtheBruisers/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNBHeod_McON5eFXyVACng\nBandCamp: https://markoandthebruisers1.bandcamp.com/\n \nLabel Name: Bruiser Records\nLabel Website: https://bruiser-records.bandcamp.com/\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUS8PnNrZjw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUS8PnNrZjw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUS8PnNrZjw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUS8PnNrZjw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUS8PnNrZjw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":981,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"zUS8PnNrZjw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/gn_i6N-Sj74dyfbhE59_UinyW4c\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LnZqZ2ZYVVVlNHo4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-15T22:03:16.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Modern Mimes - \"Love Hate\" A BlankTV World Premiere!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Modern Mimes - \"Love Hate\" - Like this video?

Modern Mimes consists of Adi Elcida Hernandez on vocals/guitar/sampling and Ernesto Paez on the double neck guitar bass. Their music can be best described as \"Future Goth,\" a term they coined in order to explain the fusion of alternative heavy guitar riffs, powerfully haunting vocals, subconscious provoking lyrics, electronic drums, and catchy pop melodies. \n\nModern Mimes came together in 2014. Ernesto came from a background of touring and playing in heavy metal bands while Adi was primarily a solo singer/songwriter. When fate allowed their forces to join, they took the time to harness their sound unrestrained by genres or trends. Modern Mimes is a perfectly chaotic reflection of the inner workings of Adi & Ernesto who create music in hopes of inspiring listeners to journey through their subconscious and look within.\n\nStay Tuned for Modern Mimes' End of Summer Tour dates. \n \nAbout The Video: We all feel the emotions of love and hate. Modern Mimes's Love Hate directed by Carla Forte is a performance music video with a deeper merit. The visuals take the viewer into the internal and cyclical battle of these emotions through an abstract approach and continual cleansing through the use of water.\n \nDirector Name: Carla Forte\nDirector Link: http://www.fortecarla.com/index.html\nProducer Name: Alexey Taran\nProducer Link: http://alexeytaran.com/index.html\n \nArtist Website: https://modernmimes.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/modernmimesmusic/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ModernMimes\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC50szWUFuc5Y0DWeBzG4BAg\nReverbNation: https://www.reverbnation.com/modernmimes\n \n \nSong Lyrics: Love/Hate\nGot so much to say\nRemove these punks from my face\nGot so much to say\nSeems my love gets in the way\nGot so much to say\nHow much longer will I take\nWith my Love-Hate\nGot so much to say\nGot so much to say\nI don’t want to be a hater\nbut your flow has gotta go\nYour infecting youths minds\nwith your the man and she’s a hoe\nAll this talk pussy-pussy, money-money, marijuana\nReally got me goin' bananas\noh oh oh\nTake it slow\noh oh oh\nLet it go\nI’m not a liar I’m not gonna deny\nI’ve got love-hate\na liar, I’m not gonna deny oh\nI’m not a liar I’m not gonna deny\nI’ve got love-hate\na liar, I’m not gonna deny\nI’ve got love-hate\nYou can’t fight fear with fear\nNot sure if you can fight it with love\nand the only voice that’s real is the one inside your skull\nand it says, “use me, abuse me, just make sure you don’t lose me”\nSo we let them take for goodness sake\nnever thinking it’d be a mistake\nOh oh oh\nLet it go\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vjgfXUUe4z8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vjgfXUUe4z8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vjgfXUUe4z8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vjgfXUUe4z8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vjgfXUUe4z8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":982,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"vjgfXUUe4z8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/QZ2QwXkamlI221upqjHLg5rciMw\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LjF2TERTanJPcXZz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-19T22:13:41.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Hagar Levy - \"Shore\" A BlankTV World Premiere Lyric Video!","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Hagar Levy - \"Shore\" - Like this video?

Hagar’s lyrics, melodies and harmonies are deeply influenced by female rockers and neo-soul pioneers such as Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Erykah Badu, Sade, Jill Scott and Alicia Keys.\nHer debut album was released in 2015 and received warm reviews both in Israel and worldwide. Hagar’s latest project is a live session with three singles which became highlights at solo- and band shows in the past year.\n \nDirector Name: Or Barnea\nProducer Name: Alona Nof\n \nAbout The Video: Hagar Levy's first lyric video for her latest single.

Their rock hard riffs, soaring guitar harmonies, and powerful, in your face lyrics, have built them a strong fan base in a very small amount of time. Front man Ron Jones and drummer Ken Nichols have been playing together for many years as apart of Lylah Crying before it disbanded. In mid-May 2014, Jones had written enough material to start Darkenside and shortly recruited bassist Jordan Lemire and lead guitarist Sam Mills. Within three weeks they were prepared for the band's first performance, having the highest ticket sells of the event: Savage Fest 3. Shortly after Darkenside participated in Gorilla Music's National Battle of the Bands, placing in the top three bands across the nation. Darkenside has continued to captivate their crowd and build their fan base making there show attendance and ticket sales as impressive as the bands talent . \n  Their first EP, 'From the Ashes', is quickly gaining speed and can be found on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, & more. \nWe hope to see you at the shows!\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/darkensideband/\n\n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zTzakkW4EKw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zTzakkW4EKw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zTzakkW4EKw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":985,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"zTzakkW4EKw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/0s0iXMwSruP_no_wUAUClsJDe08\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Llo3VFJjdndMRmNN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-19T03:05:18.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Ebbe Eriksson - \"Between Wine and Water\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Ebbe Eriksson - \"Between Wine and Water\" - Like this video?

BlankTV.com!\n \n***\nEbbe Eriksson - \"Between Wine and Water\" Official Music Video - A BlankTV Feature!\n \nArtist city, country: Malmö, Sweden\n \nArtist Biography: My name is Ebbe Eriksson and I'm a singer, guitar player and songwriter from Malmö, Sweden. \n\nI've created music with different constellations over the years, most recently with alternative rock band Pharoes. I've also been involved with mid 00s emocore/post-hardcore band Far Above, triphop/pop/electronic duo Head Like Orange and the metal oriented recording project Nemorosa. \n\nMaking music with other people is a relationship and it can be a beautiful thing if it's done right and everybody's on the same page. It's a creative exchange that can be hard to describe to someone who's never experienced it. I guess one could compare it to any other type of relationship. It's basically an emotional roller coaster with its ups and downs. Sometimes relationships end for new ones to begin. You outgrow each other and realize that maybe you were not on the same page after all. It's hard not to lose yourself along the way. \n\nMusic and creativity has always been very important to me. I know who I am and I have a very clear image of how I want to express myself, and that image is constantly evolving and changing. I've had thoughts about making a solo record for about ten years but it's easy to second guess yourself and get caught up in other things. Basically life happens. Recently I've reached a point where I feel that I have something to express in a new way. I'm ready to do something entirely on my own and not being dependent on anyone else. \n\nI've recorded a solo album with Tommy Tift (Vånna Inget, Sista Sekunden, True Moon) at Studio Motion. It's very different from anything I've ever done in the past but still very much me when you break it down to the core. My roots will always be in alternative rock music, but with this project i'm very influenced by 80s new wave and indie rock/pop. The songs are written with acoustic guitar in mind, and are based on me performing them solo. In the studio some of the songs took shape into something else, while still remaining its vulnerable and naked core. The performances are kept as real as possible and I've tried to stay away from multiple takes, digital fixes and overdubbing. \n\nI've decided to call the album 'Transit Songs' as it represents an emotional and musical transition from one thing to another. The album is recorded on tape and with almost exclusively analog gear. I've written and I play everything, except my cousin Joakim Jensen, who played the drums. I hope you will like it as much as i do. \n \nDirector Name: Jakob Riddarhaage\nProducer Name: Jakob Riddarhaage\n \n \nArtist Website: https://ebbeerikssonsound.tumblr.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/ebbeerikssonsound\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx6eEOyvaQgjoARRhXlEkaA\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/ebbe-eriksson\nBandCamp: https://ebbeeriksson.bandcamp.com\nTumblr: https://ebbeerikssonsound.tumblr.com\nOther Link: https://www.instagram.com/ebbeeriksson\n \n \nSong Lyrics: When the world goes to hell, \nwill you stand by me if I’m not feeling well? \nYou can bite me, I will moan, \nbut I’ll still be here when the dog days are gone. \nA friendly notice friends of mine.\nPlease don’t intercept or intertwine what’s left of me. \nBetween wine and water I’ll become a bitter entity. \nI’m better off alone. \nYou’re all better off without me. \nThe luck I’ve had will devour. \nIt’ll make anything with a heartbeat turn sour.\nI’m not insular, unkind. \nCrack a hole into my head to open up my mind. \nI could say anything you’d want with your words forced in my mouth. \nI would go anywhere you’d want on a wagon with my legs blown out. \n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z7TRcvwLFcM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z7TRcvwLFcM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z7TRcvwLFcM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z7TRcvwLFcM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z7TRcvwLFcM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":986,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Z7TRcvwLFcM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/xgEgIb5TD_dVTjMrFI1905dVZys\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LmhPQW5qbGZGQ1Rn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-19T02:50:41.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"MowMan - \"Locura\" feat.

The fact that the band was built from the scraps of many acclaimed metal bands like Orphanage, Detonation, Silicon Head, Pleurisy, Grindpad, Bleeding Gods, Tribal Spirits, Hordearii, Cavitation and Bloodphemy promises something awesome for the near metal future.\nThe band released their first EP \"The Arcane Order\" in 2016, toured Japan in early 2017 and are busy writing new material for their debut album.\n \nDirector Name: Pitch Note Productions\nDirector Link: http://www.pitchnote.nl/\nProducer Name: Pitch Note Productions\nProducer Link: http://www.pitchnote.nl/\n \nAbout The Video: Take a trip down memory lane with us to the land of the rising sun during our 'Roaming Japan Tour' in February 2017.\n \nArtist Website: http://www.shinigami.band/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/shinigami.metalband/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYv6qKC-Y1YCaxgPC-0ljQ\nBandCamp: https://shinigami-official.bandcamp.com/\nOther Link: https://play.spotify.com/artist/3mp9Isfpx6TYaB9vhZZFKV \n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_lEgpANcrU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_lEgpANcrU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_lEgpANcrU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_lEgpANcrU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_lEgpANcrU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":990,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"u_lEgpANcrU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/DYzQSKjNbKzqBr1DEisEOnL4ZMg\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Ll8tMWd6NlgzWnYw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-14T00:59:19.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Henchmen from Mars - \"It's Squishy\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Henchmen from Mars - \"It's Squishy\" - Like this video?

The band incorporates crushing riffs and sonic ranged vocals. \n“We just wanted to make a really raw massive album,” says Sean with a smirk. “Going into it, we knew that we didn't want to make the bullshit polished or over-produced record that everyone has heard over and over, so we put ourselves into the mindset that we don't give a fuck what people think, we just want to make a bad ass record that we're proud of. \"\n\nSean and his cohorts tapped into the massive energy their native Nor-Cal is known for, crafting a true metal sound. They’re not making any apologies for it either. “A Million Middle Fingers ”. is an irresistible anthem doused in gasoline!

We chose the song “Novocaine” and I think directors Nick Hess and Maggie Foster did a great job of capturing the different aspects of life for twenty-something’s living in a rural town.\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thecarolynmusic/\nBandCamp: https://thecarolyn.bandcamp.com/releases\n \nLabel Name: 59 X Records\nLabel Website: http://www.59xrecords.com/\n \nSong Lyrics: Paint me in all your favorite colors\n\nBut leave out those darker shades of red\n\n‘Cause I cringe just from thinking of the moment\n\nMy image gets destroyed inside your head\n\nAnd lay waste to every hope and dream\n\nSo we won’t wake during surgery\n\nMaybe I’ll blame it on the summer\n\nExcuses made have gone and fled\n\nWhat remains of hanging on comes into focus\n\nAnd turns into just letting go instead\n\nAnd lay waste to every hope and dream\n\nSo we won’t wake during surgery\n\nThis place numbs like Novocaine\n\nBut have faith; we’ll feel alright some day\n\nWe’re gonna feel fine some day\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Ph3PwnlgbY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Ph3PwnlgbY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Ph3PwnlgbY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Ph3PwnlgbY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Ph3PwnlgbY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":996,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_Ph3PwnlgbY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/nISNxktobAFGI_WVv3n5iBx97BI\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3Lk5jQVpIT1V2ZXhz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-09T17:30:00.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"Gørl - \"Repair the Girl\" Puppengold Records - Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - Gørl - \"Repair the Girl\" - Like this video?

They are releasing a teaser to their debut album in the form of an EP consisting of three tracks.\n\nThe tracks are dramatic and don’t shy away from big melodies and surprising twists and turns: GØRL are powered by their love of life, emotion and cold beer. The androgynous appearance of Mikala Nørgaard (vocals, guitar) perfectly complements a voice that is hard to categorize and can initially cause some bewilderment. \nThe rather mysterious lyrics, mainly written by her sister Fransiska Nørgaard, add to the confusion. Surprisingly the end result is exciting and infectious, even without the influence of beer or psychotropic substances.\n\nAs you read this text, GØRL is already in the studio recording the rest of the tracks for the album - if all goes to plan, it'll be ready by the end of the year. On that note, a big shout out goes to the amazing team at Cosmix Studios in Vienna, who provided the means for some unforgettable recording sessions.\n\nThe first three tracks will be released on the 30th June, on GØRL's 'Repair the Girl' EP. The unadulterated rock single \"Repair the Girl\" is seen, (not only by the band), as the starting point of a psychedelic journey. The tracks \"Clockwise Love\" and \"River Child\" provide a small yet meaningful glimpse into their stylistic range.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the ride. Here's to an exciting journey!\nLet the beer be chilled, always.\n \nArtist Website: https://www.facebook.com/goerlmusic/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/goerlmusic/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Puppengold\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/puppengold-records\n \nLabel Name: Puppengold Records\nLabel Website: http://www.puppengold.com\n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcAZHOUvexs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcAZHOUvexs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcAZHOUvexs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcAZHOUvexs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcAZHOUvexs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BlankTV","playlistId":"UU8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","position":997,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NcAZHOUvexs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/i8UVDaxHvHK4BlGMRrzJvD-VEgM\"","id":"VVU4bDlmckw2MVlsNUtGT2w4N25JbTJ3LktXdndDWHNmektJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-08T18:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC8l9frL61Yl5KFOl87nIm2w","title":"The DogHunters - \"Hip Lightning Shoes\" Official Music Video","description":"http://www.BlankTV.com - The DogHunters - \"Hip Lightning Shoes\" - Like this video?
