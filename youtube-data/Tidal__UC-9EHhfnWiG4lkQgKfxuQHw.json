Along with guitarist GL Jaguar, lead singer Katie Alice Greer and drummer Daniele Daniele have been breathing new life into the D.C. music community with their explosive performances and record label, Sister Polygon Records. With records like Nothing Feels Natural and Bodies and Control and Money and Power, Priests tackle late capitalism powerfully with angular post-punk assaults. The tunes are catchy and the message is messy, exposing a personal-is-political shared culpability without preaching solutions. There’s definitely dancing at Priests’ revolution. In this episode, Katie and Daniele discuss oral therapy, figure skating, accelerationism, and running away from home to see Snoop Dogg.\n\nPhoto credit to Farrah Skeiky","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jxWsKAl-j9Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jxWsKAl-j9Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jxWsKAl-j9Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jxWsKAl-j9Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jxWsKAl-j9Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"TIDAL","playlistId":"UU-9EHhfnWiG4lkQgKfxuQHw","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jxWsKAl-j9Y"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/4M8n6YV3z6Byx8sFFWJIxnSgi1A\"","id":"VVUtOUVIaGZuV2lHNGxrUWdLZnh1UUh3LmU1NEQ3MUdSUHdZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-28T16:00:04.000Z","channelId":"UC-9EHhfnWiG4lkQgKfxuQHw","title":"Coca Vision: G Perico, Episode 30","description":"To hear past episodes of Coca Vision, sign up for TIDAL at TIDAL.com/onair and receive a free 90-day offer. \n\nOn this episode, Fat Joe is joined by the Los Angeles own, G Perico.

Later enhanced by former Slits’ drummer Paloma “Palmolive” Romero and classically trained violinist Vicky Aspinall, the Raincoats challenged traditional song structures to reflect the conflicting moods and tempos of the lives they led. \n\nWhile hailed as heroes in the canon of underground, feminist punk, the Raincoats have been somewhat overlooked by rock historians. Illuminating the Raincoats’ body of work as “a celebration of the female interior life,” author Jenn Pelly profiles the band and cements its legacy in her book The Raincoats.

Before the Pacific Northwest became an alternative music destination, Patty had grown up feeling awkward as a lesbian in a small town in Washington State. She soon found her voice through drumming and punk. Patty became a role model as one of the few female drummers on a major label and for coming out publicly in 1995 in Rolling Stone magazine.\nIn her new book, Hit So Hard: A Memoir, Patty details her struggles growing up and avoiding conflict, escaping through addiction, and living a life of recovery beyond her identity as the drummer for Hole. In this episode of I’m in the Band, Patty talks coming out and coming of age in the ‘80s and ‘90s Northwest music scene and making fanzines with Kurt and Courtney.\n\n\n\nPhoto courtesy of Melissa Auf der Maur\n\nHosted by: Allison Wolfe\n\nProduced by: Jonathan Shifflett","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGaQLlB_7fQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGaQLlB_7fQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGaQLlB_7fQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGaQLlB_7fQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGaQLlB_7fQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"TIDAL","playlistId":"UU-9EHhfnWiG4lkQgKfxuQHw","position":73,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qGaQLlB_7fQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ppYkT_bRMuHvre26147MqyZkqbc\"","id":"VVUtOUVIaGZuV2lHNGxrUWdLZnh1UUh3Lk5YaW9uU04zOF80","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-17T20:26:44.000Z","channelId":"UC-9EHhfnWiG4lkQgKfxuQHw","title":"Subscribe to TIDAL","description":"From free concerts to exclusive music videos to original video content and more, TIDAL offers its members unique ways to engage with their favorite artists, as well as live experiences fans cannot find anywhere else.

The image of this fierce frontwoman of the Bags glaring into the audience and screaming into the microphone paved the way for girls like me to pick up the mic and start our own bands.\n\nIn her 2011 memoir Violence Girl, Alice describes growing up in East LA and how she transitioned from glam fandom to finding her voice in punk rock. She continues to make music, write, and agitate for social justice; she’s also finishing up her second solo album for Don Giovanni Records. In this third episode of “I’m in the Band,” Alice tells host Allison Wolfe about the early days of Los Angeles punk, fighting historical erasure as a queer women of color, and her lifetime of cultural activism. \n\nRead about episode 3: http://read.tidal.com/article/im-in-the-band-ep-3-allison-wolfe-alice-bag\n\nAbout I'm in the Band: Bratmobile and Riot Grrrl co-founder Allison Wolfe converses with prominent punk/indie artists for her own show “I’m in the Band\".
