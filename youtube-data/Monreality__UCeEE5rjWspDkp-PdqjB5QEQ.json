\"There Shouldn't Be Kids Who Don't Know The Legends\"","description":"Full interview :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSTj4symj7c\n\n\"We do not stay 21 forever, I tried. Doing a history lesson on rap is actually fun as f*ck. Me and DJ Drama had a conversation he said Lil Uzi Vert doesn't know who DJ Premier is, he's only 20 years old it's not his fault - I told him, you're right, it's your fault. (..) When old dudes aren't able to hang around and relate, the easiest thing to do is hate, the easiest thing to do is say in my days. If you ignore what's going on right now, that's the definition of what makes you old.
