So when he expressed his desire to squeeze a 10-piece string section behind the Tiny Desk for his three-song performance, we were more than happy to oblige him.\n\nMorton showed off the soulful Fender Rhodes chops that helped him earn a mentor in Stevie Wonder and membership to Maroon 5, while backed by percussion, bass and the same Matt Jones Orchestra that accompanies him on his soulful solo releases, Gumbo and Gumbo Unplugged.\n\nHe began prepping what would become his noteworthy pot of musical stew after moving back home to New Orleans from L.A. a couple of years ago. The preacher's kid with the gospel roots wound up collecting two 2018 Grammy nominations for music from Gumbo, his fourth studio LP. Ironically, those industry accolades came as a direct result of Morton choosing to go his own way.\n\n\"So many people didn't want me to be myself,\" he told the Tiny Desk crowd during the intro to \"Claustrophobic,\" a song about the attempts major labels made to box him in. \"But I decided I was going to be PJ no matter what people told me and tried to get me to do.\"\n\nThey tried some strange things, too. One record exec interested in signing him even suggested pairing Morton with popular West Coast hip-hop producer DJ Mustard. \"It was so far off base,\" he told NPR's Michel Martin last January. Instead, he started his independent music label, Morton Records, with the vision of creating a new Motown in his hometown.\n\nNew Orleans' musical lineage seasons the entire set of his Tiny Desk performance, including the second song, \"Go Thru Your Phone,\" on which Morton's joined by backing vocalists The Amours. All together, it made for a total of 15 musicians squeezed behind Bob Boilen's desk — not to mention Matt Jones, conducting off-camera. The industry may not have seen the vision, but from where we stood it was a perfect fit.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Claustrophobic\"\n\"Go Thru Your Phone\"\n\"First Began\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPJ Morton(lead vocals/rhodes), Brian Cockerham (bass), Ed Clark (percussion), Matt Jones (Matt Jones Orchestra Conductor), Clayton Penrose-Whitmore (Violin), Arianne Urban (Violin), Olya Prohorova (Violin), Alexandria Hill (Violin), Danielle Taylor (Violin), Istvan Loga (Viola), Caitlin Adamson (Viola), Seth Woods (Cello), Malik Johnson (Cello), Victor Ray Holms (Bass), Jakiya Ayanna (background vocals), Shaina Aisha (background vocals)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Rodney Carmichael, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Khun Minn Ohn, Maia Stern, Bronson Arcuri; Production Assistants: Catherine Zhang, Téa Mottolese; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SZxnLj2cSzY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SZxnLj2cSzY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SZxnLj2cSzY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SZxnLj2cSzY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SZxnLj2cSzY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SZxnLj2cSzY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/rZHakpT7YG0F1tW9adaLRc7ceV8\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnlWb2E0c3hJcUdz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-07-07T09:00:06.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Golden Dawn Arkestra: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"June 29, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It was a late night at an unfamiliar club in Austin, Texas when the spirit, sound, lights and costumes of the Golden Dawn Arkestra put a huge, dreamy smile on my face. It took more than three years to get ten of the players and performers in this band (there are often even more) to my desk. I tried to transform the bright daylight of the NPR office with some of my handy, previously used holiday laser lights. But honestly, it wasn't until their psychedelic jazz kicked in that the office transformation felt real. Band leader, Topaz squawked through his megaphone to join them on their journey, while singing \"Children of the Sun.\"\n\nTopaz told me that the band's inspiration for both the name and the spirit of the musicians is loosely based on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The organization, devoted to the study of the occult and paranormal activities, has been around since the 19th century.\n\nBoth of Topaz's parents were heavily into spiritual movements and what happens here falls somewhere between high art and a circus, with music that feels connected to Sun Ra's jazz, the extended musical adventures of The Doors and the surprise elements of Parliament-Funkadelic.

Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest — who produced and co-wrote \"King's Paradise\" with keyboardist Adrian Younge under their new project The Midnight Hour — played bass, and rising blues torchbearer Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram sat in on guitar.\n\n\"King's Paradise\" pays homage to the heroes of the Harlem Renaissance as well as its fictional superhero, the bulletproof Luke Cage. Rakim tipped his hat to Philip Payton Jr., Joe Lewis, Lena Horne, Malcolm X, Maya Angelou and Louis Armstrong, before concluding with a few bars about the comic book-inspired series.\n\nYounge then led the nine-member backing band through two of Rakim's undeniable classics: \"Paid in Full\" and \"Know the Ledge.\" For the former, drummer David Henderson rolled right in with the unmistakable breakbeat, — originally sampled from The Soul Searchers \"Ashley's Roachclip.\" Muhammad, who's been playing bass since age 19 despite being known for his production and DJ work, provided the low end for \"Know The Ledge.\"\n\nRakim released his first single 32 years ago, yet the timbre of his voice and Dali Llama aura remain strong.

So when Matthews shed his backing players to swing by the Tiny Desk for a solo gig, he couldn't just knock out three songs and bail. Instead, he played a set so long — so defiantly un-Tiny — that his between-song banter could have filled a Tiny Desk concert on its own.\n\nAfter a bit of judicious trimming, we're still left with this warm, winning, utterly game, happily overstuffed performance, which balances songs from Dave Matthews Band's new album Come Tomorrow (\"Samurai Cop,\" \"Here on Out\") with older material (1998's \"Don't Drink the Water,\" 2012's \"Mercy\") and a deeper cut from his 2003 solo album (\"So Damn Lucky\").

The program (distributed by NPR) is a potent antidote to any gloom-and-doom doubter.\n\nFor over 20 years, From the Top has built an impressive platform to celebrate the music, lives and stories of youngsters playing classical music. That's right. Young people in this country love classical music.\n\nWe invited three talented From the Top musicians to the Tiny Desk. No squeaky violins here. These kids are terrific players.\n\nSparks fly (and bow hairs, too) when 12-year-old violinist Kaia Selden tears into Henryk Wieniawski's rip-snorting Scherzo-Tarentelle.

That's what happened when the bass and drums from D.C.'s pioneering punk band Fugazi crisscrossed with the brilliant, skillful and younger guitarist Anthony Pirog. It's only fitting that this Tiny Desk Concert happened on D.C. turf.\n\nI've seen Anthony in a number of settings around town, including the brilliant duo he has with his wife, cellist Janel Leppin called Janel and Anthony. His playing can be understated and over-the-top all at the same time. It never feels self-indulgent and his music always serves the song. Drummer Brendan Canty saw the guitarist perform once and they eventually formed a band. Together, Brendan and bassist Joe Lally are a brilliant pulse of energy and that allows Anthony the freedom to fly. The music they create is like no other.

(FYI: He graduated in the Class of 2016. Feel old yet?) And before singing \"Saved,\" Khalid explained that this was one of the first songs he ever wrote and remembers that when he put it up on SoundCloud, a rude commenter tried to diminish his talent. Obviously, he didn't let the negative energy stop him.\n\n\"I honestly couldn't tell you what that guy is doing with his life but he's not doing this,\" Khalid said with a contagious laugh.\n\nKhalid's music narrates life's awkwardly necessary moments: the butterflies of young love, the angst of craving freedom, the apprehension of teetering on that next step in life. He creates honest, comforting pop for teens and young adults that speaks to the kid in all of us. Accompanied only by acoustic guitarist Jef Villaluna, the 20-year-old sensation captured this fleeting fearlessness of youth and brought it to the Tiny Desk for a heartfelt serenade session. The way his voice glided calmly over the guitar notes, switching between baritone and tenor, was fitting given that he sings about teenage peaks and pitfalls. Khalid's sense of wide-eyed yet humble wonder permeates through the entire set.\n\nKhalid finished his set with a mini bow and a peace sign to the audience, but made sure to squeeze in time for some of the diehard fans in the crowd of NPR employees and their guests — many of whom were gleeful teens, some just as awkward, angsty and wide-eyed as he when penning his first songs in high school.

A new generation of musicians are taking the training they received in Cuba's fabled classical music academies to new heights by incorporating not just jazz, but hip-hop, funk and any manner of experimental music. Yissy García and Bandancha may be the best example of that vanguard.\n\nFrom the moment you hear the pre-recorded sound collage underneath the credits, it's a sign we're not in the Buena Vista Social Club. The compositions (all by García) are modern and reflect the cosmopolitan attitude that is common in big city life in Cuba. For example, \"Ultima Noticia\" is highlighted by the riffs thrown back and forth between drummer García and the turntablist, DJ Jigüe. The command of time and imagination García displays in her first drum solo of the set is simply astonishing.\n\nThe entire set is a lesson of contemporary Cuban music. The rapping on \"Universo\" reminded me of Cuba in the early 1990s when hip-hop entered the national consciousness as the Soviet Union left the island to fend for itself economically. On this track, it's a celebration of the universal goodness we all share.\n\nThe band winds up their time behind the desk by going back to Cuba's African roots for a rumba-soaked jam with sampled Afro-Cuban drums and rhythms. The complexity of the music meshes lockstep with passionate singing and dancing.\n\nYissy García and Bandancha are already Havana favorites, and I'm thrilled they're finally getting a chance to spread their music around the world.

As a D.C. native, the skinny, stylish rapper acted as if his Tiny Desk performance was a family reunion and took the opportunity to invite everybody and their cousin in as his guests.\n\nTo mark the moment, Link wore a crisp T-shirt reading 'I Told You So' — a nod to the haters, no doubt — and jumped around his discography to perform cuts from each of his three projects: \"Bedtime Story\" from 2014's The God Complex, \"Dark Skin Women\" from 2015's And After That, We Didn't Talk and finally \"Some Girl\" and \"Pray Everyday (Survivor's Guilt)\" from 2017's At What Cost. But instead of the usual Steve Lacy or Kaytranada-aided beats, Link delivered his verses accompanied by a smooth six-piece band and two velvet-voiced singers. (Link's longtime producer Louie Lastic plays bass for the entire set.)\n\n\"Thank y'all for being here. It's mad overwhelming lowkey,\" Link admitted with a laugh at the audience that had flocked in his honor. As he loosened up, Link made time for bossa nova steps and shoulder shimmies, and by the end of the four-song set, he had the crowd swaying as well.\n\nLast year was a significant one for the 25-year-old rapper once considered one of hip-hop's oddballs. His incorporation of electro-bounce beats into tongue-twisting rhymes earned Link a web following back in 2013, but it was just last year when he finally heard his voice on national radio thanks to the breakout track \"Crew.\" The subdued stinger produced by Teddy Walton and featuring fellow D.C. area natives Brent Faiyaz and Shy Glizzy showcased Link's nonchalant cadence in a digestible fashion. While \"Crew\" enjoyed a slow burn — gradually accumulating streams and spins as a summer song in 2017 and earning the artist his first Grammy nomination earlier this year in the category of Best Rap Performance — it also positioned him as a new musical savior of his city.

Even though the skies threatened rain and thunder, the overcast light lingering in our dimmed office space allowed the teardrop pendant lights, hung from the ceiling by her lighting team, to cast the desk in a warm, honey-hued glow. And while the nimble guitar strings and double-time drums of her supporting band was enough to dizzy the focus in the room, it was the U.K. singer's slow, silky cadence that anchored the performance in tranquility.\n\nAs Smith worked her way up the scales to each high note in \"On My Mind\" (a track usually sung over a reverberated garage beat) and \"Teenage Fantasy\" (a ballad to love lost written when she was 16), there wasn't an ounce of pressure evident in her face or body language. When she closed her eyes to deliver the rap verse of \"Blue Lights,\" the anti-injustice song that first positioned her as a SoundCloud darling in 2016, a hush fell over the room in awe of her precision.\n\nThough Smith's boldface collaborations to date range from Drake to Kali Uchis, her debut album Lost & Found is free of featured acts. Much like this Tiny Desk performance, those 12 tracks show off Smith's talent in a minimalist way — musing about life and love with the ambiguity and sense of agency that only comes with newfound freedom.\n\nAfter she finished, but before retreating to the comfort of Supreme sweats, Smith and her band bestowed the Tiny Desk with a blue lava lamp signed by every member.

Before the concert, we talked a lot with her and her production team about how to best share her deeply affecting, anthemic pop songs. Should we have a choir? Maybe a string quartet? Or should she bring out all her gear and perform as a one-woman band, live looping everything with backing tracks, to recreate the album experience? In the end she chose the simplest (and perhaps most fitting arrangement for an artist often billed as a one-woman riot): just MILCK, by herself, with a keyboard.\n\nFew artists can wreck me so quickly and completely as MILCK does with her songs about lonely outcasts, troubled souls and survivors who soldier on in a world that doesn't believe in them. In fact, she opened this Tiny Desk with her stirring ballad \"Black Sheep,\" a song she and I bonded over during an emotional interview earlier this year, when we discovered we were both the square pegs of our respective families. It's also a song I can barely even think about without tearing up.\n\nPerhaps it's because the ultimate message in \"Black Sheep,\" like pretty much all of MILCK's music, is that you are not alone. It's a celebration of universal, unconditional love, something the whole world could stand to hear and get behind. These songs also resonate so profoundly because they come from a genuine and heartfelt place – from MILCK's own experiences and not a corporate office churning out scientifically proven pop formulas (though to be sure, she has a voice as thunderous and a range as wide as some of our biggest pop music stars).\n\nMILCK followed \"Black Sheep\" with a sobering version of \"Quiet\" before closing with a brand-new song, \"Oh My My.\" Calling it \"infuriatingly joyful,\" it documents the journey she's taken, and where she's landed, with one simple, beautiful refrain: \"What a life, what a life, what a life, what a life.\"\n\nSet List\n\n\"Black Sheep\"\n\"Quiet\"\n\"Oh My My\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nConnie Lim (vocals, piano)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame; Production Assistant: Stefanie Fernández; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9C55DOhatXc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9C55DOhatXc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9C55DOhatXc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9C55DOhatXc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9C55DOhatXc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":10,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9C55DOhatXc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/hrJhaeYHxgm5UV5lncmIe5e1ICY\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlNCemlUSThWZkFR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-13T09:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Grace VanderWaal: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"June 6, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- When 14-year-old Grace VanderWaal came to perform at the Tiny Desk I had to confess to her (and her mom) that, until my \"accidental concert experience,\" I had no idea who she was, nor did I know what America's Got Talent was.\n\nIt all started this past February, when I went to the 9:30 Club, a 1,200 capacity music venue, to see what I thought was a show by rock guitarist Grace Vonderkuhn and her power trio from Delaware.\n\nWhen I arrived for the unusually early 7:30pm show, I saw a long line of young teens wrapping around the block, mostly girls, and a fair smattering of adults who didn't look like the regular concert goers who head to the 9:30 Club on a weekday evening. And as you've likely guessed by now, the show I was about to witness was not the riff-rock guitar player we'd recently featured on All Songs Considered but a very different sort of wunderkind who won the hearts of millions as the 11th winner of America's Got Talent and, now, a Columbia recording artist.\n\nInside the club was a massively enthralled and enthused crowd and it didn't take long for me, one of the few older guys in the club, to also be completely swept away by her performance. It was a dazzling show that felt fresh, sincere, bold but also simple, with Grace on ukulele singing songs such as \"Moonlight,\" a song about a friend dealing with mental health issues, which she also performs here at my desk.\n\n\"She always has a smile\nFrom morning to the night\nThe perfect poster child\nThat was once in my life\nA doll made out of glass\nAll her friends think that she's great\nBut I can see through it all\nAnd she's about to break\"\n\nDespite what I feel is my broad love of music, I was reminded how easy it is to get comfortable in the musical confines we devise for ourselves. It's easy to stereotype artists and perhaps be dismissive of something that falls outside our comfort zone. But Grace's show and music reminds me to keep my thoughts and judgements open. So, if you're about to pass on watching this one, figuring you're not going to connect with a young teen and her music, stop. Take a deep breath, open up your heart and let Grace VanderWaal enchant you with her unique talent.\n\nGrace VanderWaal's current album is called Just the Beginning.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Moonlight\"\n\"Darkness Keeps Chasing Me\"\n\"Clearly\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nGrace VanderWaal (vocals, ukulele), Melissa Dougherty (guitar, background vocals)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern; Production Assistant: Niki Walker; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBziTI8VfAQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBziTI8VfAQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBziTI8VfAQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBziTI8VfAQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBziTI8VfAQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":11,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SBziTI8VfAQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/gbL1uefTfFg9vgxNvgC_e6fDyHQ\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlJKNnNFbmwtM2tn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-12T18:46:45.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Between The World And Black Thought","description":"Black Thought's been basking in overdue props lately.

While already confined to a small space, they opted to congregate at the piano, where producer and music director Matthew Burnett sat to create what feels like a fly-on-the-wall moment. We're presented a purity that's nearly impossible to capture on an album.\n\nThe success of Caesar's debut LP, Freudian, has created a groundswell of fanfare and exposure for the 23-year-old singer-songwriter. It was nominated for two Grammys and won two Junos (Canada's equivalent to the Grammys). We've seen him perform on Late Night with Seth Meyers, pop stars are serenading him with his own songs and his set at this year's Coachella festival was one of the most buzzed about (behind the queen Bey, of course). Caesar's is an organic ascent that's yet to reach its peak.\n\nCaesar carries a coy aura about him, until he opens his mouth to sing. The years of training in church, fused with natural talent, is on full display. Supporting vocalists Camille Harrison, Danah Berry and Nevon Sinclair are in tow for the whole ride, providing some of the richest harmonies we've heard at the Tiny Desk. I found myself fixated on the playful manner in which the band members interacted with each other.\n\nCaesar didn't hold back with the set list. He performed his three most-streamed songs (a combined 249,000,000 plays on Spotify alone), including \"Best Part,\" which included a Tiny Desk guest appearance by NPR Music favorite H.E.R.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Japanese Denim\"\n\"Get You\"\n\"Best Part (feat.

As much as his drums slap, guitar is the foundation for most of his songs and he showcases a burgeoning talent on the instrument throughout his set.\n\nI first caught wind of this UK wunderkind in 2014. Crafting his own instrumental projects and remixing tracks by artists ranging from Busta Rhymes to Lianne La Havas, Misch steadily garnered a dedicated following on SoundCloud. From there, he collaborated with other London artists and released EPs of original music on the platform. Misch's style doesn't revel in what's going on in pop music today; like a handful of other artists from the UK, his interpretation of hip-hop and R&B is a continuation of what the greats who came before him started. A healthy dose of that inspiration is drawn from the late J. Dilla, while Misch's up-tempo dance numbers align him with the Kaytranadas of the world. In 2016, Misch — still just 21 years old at the time — decided to dabble more in songwriting and explore that soothing timbre of his voice on Reverie, and all of a sudden, his potential rose exponentially.\n\nMisch and the band arrived bright and early to get situated behind the Tiny Desk and rehearse. Misch has said before that he isn't a jazz purist intrinsically, but the way he opens up a guitar solo or jams with saxophonist Braxton Cook, jazz music certainly runs through him.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Tom Misch before this performance, now's a good time to catch up. Check out his breakthrough album, Geography, as well as his earlier collaborations, then come back and watch his Tiny Desk again for a true appreciation of his growth as an artist.\n\nSET LIST\n\"It Runs Through Me\"\n\"I Wish\"\n\"Movie\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTom Misch (guitar/vocals), Tobias Tripp (guitar/violin/vocals), James Creswick (bass), Jamie Houghton (drums), Joseph Price (keys), Braxton Cook (saxophone)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Sidney Madden, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Beck Harlan; Production Assistant: Stefanie Fernández; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IUMTaAQ43lY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IUMTaAQ43lY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IUMTaAQ43lY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IUMTaAQ43lY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IUMTaAQ43lY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":14,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"IUMTaAQ43lY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/hPwgiV4NZf7oaVVnhQekwsVC3y4\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjU5MmNySlVCZ0dj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-06T09:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Trouble Funk: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"May 30, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- Go-go — Washington D.C.'s regional twist on funk — reigned in the DMV during the 1980s, and one of the scene's signature acts was Trouble Funk. More than 30 years later, the collective, led by Big Tony Fisher, still fills sold-out venues with heavyweight percussion and call-and-response lyrics. Trouble Funk concerts are bona fide jam sessions, so I was determined to squeeze their unrelenting rhythms behind the Tiny Desk.\n\nWith 12 members sandwiched into a cramped space, the electricity was almost tangible as they launched into the 1982 banger \"Pump Me Up,\" a song sampled in Public Enemy's protest anthem \"Fight the Power\" and M/A/R/R/S's dance classic \"Pump Up The Volume.\" The drum breaks here are definitive go-go and it was hard to discern who was having more fun: the band or the audience. On \"Grip It,\" buoyant and staccato horn melodies propelled the song forward, while \"Let's Get Small\" featured Trouble Funk's classic call-and-response chants. \"Drop the Bomb,\" another notable gem from their lengthy discography, kept the energy level high and \"Don't Touch That Stereo\" was all raw, unencumbered funk. To conclude the set, they segued into \"E Flat Boogie,\" their first hit in 1979, with Big Tony's vocals front and center.\n\nWhile the late Chuck Brown is often acknowledged as the godfather of go-go (and you can see why during his Tiny Desk), Trouble Funk was a key part of the sound's second wave. In a city often interrupted by the transient revolving door of government officials and federal staffers, the funky artform is woven into the fabric of this city and inspires a spirit of dance, rhythm and sheer joy.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Pump Me Up\"\n\"Grip It\"\n\"Let's Get Small\"\n\"Drop The Bomb\"\n\"It's In The mix\" (Don't Touch That Stereo)\"\n\"E-Flat Boogie\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBig Tony Fisher (bass), Allyson Johnson (keyboards), James Avery (keyboards), Tony Edwards (drums), Chris Allen (percussion), Larry Blake (percussion), Dean Harris (trumpet), Eric Silvan (saxophone), Paul Phifer (trombone), Derrick Ward (vocals), Keith White (vocals), David Gussom (guitar).\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Maia Stern, Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/592crJUBgGc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/592crJUBgGc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/592crJUBgGc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/592crJUBgGc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/592crJUBgGc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":15,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"592crJUBgGc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/fkkRYSlw4acbNcr68cv1IGufzm4\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjlRVF9BMEhIalVB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-05T09:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Third Coast Percussion: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"May 29, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- Back at the beginning of time, the human voice was the very first instrument. Probably close in second place were folks banging on stuff – in other words, percussionists. The quartet of gentlemen who form the Chicago-based Third Coast Percussion takes primordial pounding into a completely distinctive new league. To be sure, in this Tiny Desk performance, they'll play their sophisticated, modern marimbas and vibraphones, but be on the lookout for the subtleties of tuned cowbells and 3/4\" galvanized steel pipes, like those found at the local hardware store. Add to that a glockenspiel, a MIDI synth, a melodica, a drum kit, children's deskbells, crotales, a Thai gong and a singing bowl, and you've got significant noise-making potential behind Bob Boilen's desk.\n\nThe mesmerizing opening number, \"Niagara,\" written by the group, is from the band's latest album, the aqua-centric Paddle to the Sea. This water is fast-moving, with pulsing, repeating patterns in the vibraphone, punctuated by drum beats and a bed of low synth. The Third Coasters follow with another from the album, their own arrangement of a slowly rippling ode to the Amazon River by Philip Glass. Beginning with droplets on the glockenspiel and evocative bowing of both vibraphone and crotales (small bronze discs), the music flows softly, taking its time to fan out in all its quiet beauty.\n\nTorched and Wrecked is, as David Skidmore mentions, something that once happened to his band mate Sean Connors' automobile. It's also a butt-kicking ride that includes those steel conduit pipes, which the band cuts to specific lengths to get the desired pitches. Skidmore wrote the piece, but it's Connors who appears to achieve a kind of cathartic glee pounding on the metal tubes.\n\nIn these performances the musicians prove that there's far more to a top-notch percussion ensemble than pounding on stuff.

Tiny Desk!?!? You don't understand. I've been praying on this\", she replied. \"This (message) made my year and my band is ready!\"\n\nIll Camille strays a bit from the hip-hop zeitgeist. She raps about love and family serving as the source of her strength, the importance of self-worth as a woman, and the necessity to nurture oneself from within. That core keeps her secure even when confronted by the despair of poverty and the difficult grind of a young artist. And you can hear all that front and center in her music.\n\nHer voice is like a cool drink on a summer's day: smooth, clear and replenishing. Her refreshing self-awareness and raw honesty are inherent in each song, pairing nicely with the jazzy, melodic rhythms provided by her close knit crew of musicians. The first two songs, \"Spider's Jam\" and \"Live it Up,\" feature long time collaborators of Camille's, Iman Omari and drummer Greg Paul of Inglewood collective The Katalyst. Aneesa Strings, a bassist from the Bay Area, provided the low end foundation while also lending her rich vocals to \"Fight On.\" Also, guesting on this song is fellow L.A. native and emcee Damani Nkosi, who's been rocking with Camille since her debut album, The Pre-Write. The four-song set concluded with the upbeat \"Again,\" an ode to happiness and self-actualization.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Spider's Jam\"\n\"Live It Up\"\n\"Fight On\"\n\"Again\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCamille Davis (vocals), Iman Omari (keys), Greg Paul (drums), Aneesa Strings (bass), Damani Nkosi (vocals)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Dani Lyman; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, J.

She sang the break-up story with a smirk that belied the heartache hiding in her poignant lyrics. Then, after a short set break starring the Tiny Desk engineer Josh Rogosin, Juanes joined her to perform the duo's sultry single, \"Amárrame\" (Tie Me Up).\n\nIt's rare to see Juanes in such an intimate setting. After almost two decades of performing solo, the Latin pop star is more of a stadium and arena kind of guy. It's a treat to hear his voice unencumbered by loud speakers or crowd noise, and to see his facial expressions as he sings lyrics that many of us know by heart. This marked a return to the intimacy that fueled his earliest days and that's still present in the personal lyrics that have sold millions of records.\n\nThat intimacy was heightened by the presence of Laferte. The duo performed a PG-13 version of \"Amárrame,\" a passionate pop song with lyrics reminiscent of 50 Shades Of Grey. You can sense an obvious chemistry between the two during that song, as well as on the Juanes classic \"Fotografia\" (which originally featured Nelly Furtado).\n\nJuanes closed out the concert solo with a stripped-down version of \"Es Tarde\" from his last album, Mis Planes Son Amarte. The performance demonstrates why Juanes and Laferte's duet tour sold out across the U.S. this year. There is a magic here that makes for repeated viewing. It's that much fun to watch.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Pa' Dónde Se Fue\" by Mon Laferte\n\"Amárrame [feat. Juanes]\" by Mon Laferte\n\"Fotografía [feat.

We started early so they could hustle back to Manhattan for a 7 p.m. curtain.\n\nThe story of The Band's Visit, composer David Yazbek told the Tiny Desk audience, \"is about hope and faith and silence and music.\" It tells the tale of Egyptian musicians stranded in a small Israeli village. The townspeople have no choice but to take them in. Eventually, the love of music allows the characters to see past their differences and form an unlikely bond in a single night. The musical was adapted from the 2007 film and has been nominated for 11 Tony Awards.\n\nFrom the first note strummed on the oud, Yazbek's nominated score transports the Tiny Desk to the Middle East with traditional instrumentation and melodies, and weaves in beautiful theatrical ballads.\n\nAmong the cast are Tony Shalhoub (known for his TV roles in Monk and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) and Broadway veteran Katrina Lenk (Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, Once and Indecent). They both have been nominated for their lead performances.\n\nAlthough it's a Broadway smash hit, it lacks the opulent, bring-down-the-house song and dance numbers. It's a more intimate show with some universal messages that fit the up, close and personal space of the Tiny Desk.\n\nThe Band's Visit insists that it's OK, even essential, to get \"stuck\" with strangers who have different perspectives. It serves as a poignant reminder that our common connection to music can rise above the noise of intolerance.\n\nYazbek's poem Itgara'a, translated here from Arabic and sung a cappella by Tony Shalhoub, sums up the show's philosophy:\n\nWhen you drink, drink deeply.\n\nDrink deeply of the moonlight\n\ndrink deeply of the dark\n\nof the loneliness\n\nof the joy.\n\nYou will never drain the moonlight\n\nyou can never end the dark.\n\nIn your eyes, the flash of joy\n\nin your mouth, the sweet shock of honey.\n\nYou are the joy\n\nyou are the loneliness.\n\nDrink deep.\n\nMUSICIANS \nHarvey Valdes (oud / guitar), Garo Yellin (cello), Sam Sadigursky (clarinets), Ossama Farouk (darbuka / frame drum), Alexandra Eckhardt (bass), Andrea Grody (piano), David Yazbek (composer / host), Katrina Lenk (“Dina” / vocals), Kristen Sieh (“Iris” / vocals), Adam Kantor (“Telephone Guy” / vocals), Tony Shalhoub (“Tewfiq” / vocals), George Abud (“Camal” / violin / vocals)\n\nSET LIST\n\"Soraya\"\n\"Omar Sharif\"\n\"Itgara'a\"\n\"Haj-Butrus\"\n\"Answer Me\"\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Josh Rogosin, Morgan Noelle Smith, Tom Huizenga, Jeff Rogers; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Niki Walker, Bronson Arcuri, Maia Stern; Production Assistant: Stefanie Fernández; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWlclUJhJx8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWlclUJhJx8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWlclUJhJx8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWlclUJhJx8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWlclUJhJx8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":19,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sWlclUJhJx8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/HiQRtKVWHRy3WUa4dTlw5AdQdok\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnJXMG8tdFhKWFcw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-18T15:18:49.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Partner: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"May 18, 2018 | Robin Hilton -- This is one of the sweetest, funniest and most endearing Tiny Desk performances I've seen. From the moment they began playing, it was clear best friends Lucy Niles and Josée Caron, who perform as the Canadian rock band Partner, were there to leave their mark and have a whole lot of fun doing it.\n\nKnown for their sense of humor, joyful spirit and screaming riff rock, Partner opened their Tiny Desk not with their guitars plugged in, but with kazoos and a goofy little piano piece they dubbed the \"Tiny Desk Theme.\" Dressed like she was in an ugly sweater contest, Caron bounced along behind the keys with a beaming smile while the group (including drummer Brendan Allison, Kevin Brasier on keys and Daniel Legere on guitar) sang, \"It's the best Tiny Desk!\"\n\nThe impish left turns didn't stop there. Immediately following the makeshift theme, Caron peeled off her sweater (revealing a Tegan and Sara T-shirt) and grabbed an acoustic guitar as the band broke into its first-ever country song, a track they'd premiered at a live show just days earlier. They could barely contain their laughter while singing \"Tell You Off,\" a boom-chicka story song about giving a good tongue-lashing to anyone who gets in your way.\n\nPartner closed out its set with a surprisingly emotional version of \"Creature In The Sun,\" a reflection on appreciating the gift of just being alive. About halfway through the song, Caron took a moment to tell the audience why it was so special to them. Choking back tears, she said she wrote it about freeing the mind of desire. \"It's a very healing place... And you can just experience the fullness of life. I just wanted to... remind everyone that that stuff is right there with you all the time.\"\n\nFor a set that had been largely about laughter and playing around, it was one last surprise turn from one of my favorite new acts in recent years, and a fitting bookend to the many ways the band left its own mark on the Tiny Desk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Tiny Desk Theme\"\n\"Tell You Off\"\n\"Angels Wings\"\n\"Creature in the Sun\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nLucy Niles (guitar, vocals); Josée Caron (guitars, vocals); Brendan Allison (drums); Kevin Brasier (keys); Daniel Legere (guitar)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame, Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rW0o-tXJXW0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rW0o-tXJXW0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rW0o-tXJXW0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rW0o-tXJXW0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rW0o-tXJXW0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":20,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rW0o-tXJXW0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/nmadK58RuHc0o2vtJkYYS36LsuI\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnZXTEplcUxQZlNV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-23T09:00:07.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Khruangbin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"May 16, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It was daylight but the music was dark and moody. And despite having the office lights turned on high, it was Khruangbin's trance-inducing tone that set the mood and carried me away.\n\nThis trio from Houston, Texas is heavily inspired by 1960s and '70s funk and soul from, of all places, Thailand. That musical passion has taken them on a journey that, these days, incorporates music from Spain, Ethiopia and the Middle East. Khruangbin's largely instrumental music is grounded in Laura Lee's bass, with Mark Speer playing those melodic, richly reverbed guitar sounds and Donald \"DJ\" Johnson on drums and piano.\n\nTwo of the three songs performed at this Tiny Desk Concert are from their 2018 album Con Todo El Mundo, which is dedicated in part to Laura Lee's Mexican-American grandfather. He'd often ask her how much she loved him and the response that pleased him most was when she would say, \"con todo el mundo,\" (with all the world.)\n\nThe third track in this performance is one of the band's first forays into vocals, from their 2015 debut album, The Universe Smiles Upon You. \"White Gloves\" gently pays homage to a \"classy lady\" who was \"a fighter\" and who \"died in a fight.\" Its open-ended lyrics could imply a battle that was violent or an illness. It isn't clear. What is clear is the reverence in the song and in this music — music that strays from typical instrumental songs with heavy beats.

The band he brought and the songs they played for this winning Tiny Desk Concert made us all even prouder.\n\nNaia was chosen after we reviewed nearly 5,000 video entries. And the talent that came to us through all those submissions was astonishing. Naia Izumi won us over with his mind-boggling and unique style of guitar playing — a combination of tapping on the fingerboards and soul-filled whammy bar-note bending. And his multi-octave singing range blended so eloquently with his guitar stylings.\n\n\"Soft Spoken,\" the song he submitted, felt singular and unparalleled to our panel of judges which included past Tiny Desk contest winner Tarriona \"Tank\" Ball, Tiny Desk alum Sylvan Esso and Gaby Moreno, along with NPR family members Talia Schlanger (WXPN), Russ Borris (WFUV), Toki Wright (The Current) and the All Songs Considered team of Robin Hilton and myself. It's a song, as I hear it, that speaks to the power inherent in the gentle and quieter voices that are often drowned out by the outspoken and boisterous ones. Its title was originally \"Soft Spoken Woman\" and, as we later learned, Naia had identified as a woman for nearly seven years. More recently, as he said in an interview with Washingtonian Magazine, \"I'm not into that anymore because I just want to relax with biology and be comfortable with what I have.\"\n\nNaia is often a one-man band playing on the streets with a drum machine. But for his Tiny Desk Concert he brought bassist Adam Matijasevic and drummer Kynwyn Sterling. He'd met Kynwyn after submitting one of his songs to a math rock Facebook group. And that's the thing: Naia's music draws from so many spheres of sound. There's that punctual, rhythmic, mathematical pulse to what he does, but there's also a fluid, almost African Kalimba sound in there as well. They're two sounds I wouldn't often think of as coexisting.\n\nWe're about to go out on the road with Naia Izumi to 10 cities. We'll be joined by some of the other Contest entrants that captured our attention and they'll share the bill alongside Naia. And though there is only one Contest winner, we discovered so many other great talents that we hope to feature in the future.\n\nRemember that the spirit of the Contest is intended to bring out the best in you, to gather with friends and to create. Thank you for being a part of something so filled with magic.

This husband-and-wife banjo duo write original tunes steeped in the roots of folk music. Their playing is sweetly paced with melodies interweaving through their intricate, percussive picking all while Abigail soars above it all with her discerning, yearning voice.\n\nTheir first tune, \"Over the Divide,\" was written at the height of the Syrian Refugee Crisis. They'd read a story about a Jewish, yodeling, Austrian sheep herder who helped Syrians out of Hungary, through the backroads that likely only sheep herders know.\n\nThe second tune, \"Bloomin' Rose,\" is a response to Standing Rock and the Dakota pipeline that is seen as a threat to water and ancient burial grounds. The intensity and thoughtfulness in Bela Fleck's and Abigail Washburn's music is why it will shine for a good long while, the way great folk tunes stay relevant over the ages.\n\nFor the third tune, Abigail waddled over to a clogging board. And before she began her rhythmic patter, told us all that \"my doctor said that what I'm about to do is ok! I have compression belts and tights on that you can't see.\" They then launched into \"Take Me To Harlan,\" another one of their songs from their 2017 album Echo In The Valley.\n\nBoth Bela and Abigail have come to the Tiny Desk separately in different musical configurations: Bela with Edgar Meyer on bass fiddle and Zakir Hussain on tabla, and Abigail with her band celebrating both American and Chinese traditions.

Sophie Payten) has a dusky and evocative voice that usually gets enshrouded somehow: It often sounds like it's echoing down a stairwell, or else she's bathed it in vocal effects a la Imogen Heap or Gordi's occasional tourmate, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. But Payten's voice is an expressive and powerful instrument on its own, as her debut appearance behind the Tiny Desk demonstrates.\n\nAside from a bit of looping — in the strangely infectious notes that open \"Heaven I Know,\" from last year's terrific Reservoir — Gordi here keeps her voice both unadorned and centered within warm, cool arrangements that include piano, acoustic guitar, pedal steel, a harmonium named Barbara, a saxophone played by Yellow Ostrich's Alex Schaaf, and more. The effect here is rawer than on Reservoir, but that's part of the point: These songs stand up to being stripped down, every time.\n\nPERSONNEL\nGordi (vocals, piano, harmonium, guitar); Ben Lester (keyboards, pedal steel); Zach Hanson (drums, keyboards); Alex Schaaf (saxophone)\n\nSET LIST\n\"Heaven I Know\"\n\"Can We Work It Out\"\n\"On My Side\"\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Dani Lyman, Kara Frame; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oon_lSONbB0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oon_lSONbB0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oon_lSONbB0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oon_lSONbB0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oon_lSONbB0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":24,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Oon_lSONbB0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/dwpktcDy8GWz9n3BxJ-ukZYqzEY\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkk4c0hyRDQ4elBV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-11T09:00:04.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Darlingside: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"May 4, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Even though the world will eventually come to an end, there's still beauty and hope in all of us and in song. That about sums up the wistful mystery that is the music of Darlingside. The quartet brought dystopian storytelling wrapped in choral harmony with this performance at the Tiny Desk. Their singing is layered on a bed of percussive and melodic tones, made with guitars both acoustic and electric, violin, cello, mandolin and a tiny synthesizer. For all its upfront simplicity, in voice and acoustics, Darlingside's Tiny Desk Concert has stuck with me as a most compelling performance — a perfect match of songwriting, with contributions from all members.\n\nThe first song they performed comes from the band's 2015 debut album Birds Say. \"The God of Loss\" was inspired by the Arundhati Roy book The God of Small Things, and by the main character's attempts to preserve humanity in the face of competing forces. The other two songs Darlingside performed are from Extralife, the Boston quartet's perfectly crafted third album: \"Best of the Best of Times\" and the title track \"Extralife.\" That cut track starts off the album with these lines:\n\n\"It's over now\nThe flag is sunk\nThe world has flattened out\nUnder the under grow\nI've always found\nA level further down\nAs I begin to lose hold of\nThe fiery flowerbeds above\nMushroom clouds reset the sky\nExtralife\"\n\nThrough these end-of-time lyrics comes deep appreciation for what we have and what's worth holding on to. And through it all Darlingside's humor shines, with in-between chatter about quiche and common bonds. Don't miss this band's music. This is the perfect introduction to Darlingside, right here.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The God of Loss\"\n\"Best Of The Best Times\"\n\"Extralife\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDave Senft, Don Mitchell, Auyon Mukharji, Harris Paseltiner\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8sHrD48zPU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8sHrD48zPU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8sHrD48zPU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8sHrD48zPU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8sHrD48zPU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":25,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"I8sHrD48zPU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/TkxugVgOz1QniM7_ltUWwFQ8B1U\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkVxbWU2R0tyNTdV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-05-09T09:00:05.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"GZA & The Soul Rebels: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"May 2, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- GZA's performance at the Tiny Desk was a rare appearance for the legendary Wu-Tang Clan emcee, in part because he's notoriously introverted, and because he brought along The Soul Rebels, an eight-piece New Orleans brass ensemble. Once they stepped behind the desk they got right down to business, opening with the sparkling \"Living In The World Today,\" from GZA's 1995 solo album Liquid Swords. These 23-year old lyrics and metaphors felt timeless.\n\nGZA continued his onslaught of poetic precision with another beauty from Liquid Swords, \"Duel of the Iron Mic.\" \"I ain't particular,\" he spat, starting to break into a sweat behind the desk. \"I bang like vehicular/Homicides on July 4th in Bed-Stuy.\" At one point, GZA even channeled his cousin, the late great Ol' Dirty Bastard, who provided the hook on the original version of the track.\n\nMost rap fans would name RZA as the head of the Wu-Tang Clan. But Wu purists know that GZA, or The Genius, is the crew's unspoken elder statesman. By the third and final song at the Tiny Desk, driven by unbridled passion and his command of the room, GZA was soaked in sweat as they broke into the title track of Liquid Swords. The Soul Rebels perfectly recreated the track's seamless horn hits while adding on a bit of their own flare. The cherry on top arrived when GZA used his final minutes to tell the story of how the hook originally came together. In RZA's basement, smoking and drinking with fellow Wu lyricist Masta Killa, RZA was sold on a routine he, GZA and ODB used to perform as teens. But I'll leave it to him to tell you all about it in this unforgettable performance.\n\nThis set was recorded when The Soul Rebels were in Washington, D.C. for a performance at the 9:30 Club that featured GZA and Talib Kweli.

Azniv Korkejian is Bedouine, a singer and acoustic guitarist who echoes sounds from the 1960's North American folk songwriters, but with vocal inflections that feel closer to Leonard Cohen than to Joni Mitchell or Joan Baez.\n\nAzniv Korkejian was born in Aleppo Syria. Her parents were Armenian and she spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia. But a green card lottery win found her family moving to Boston and Houston. Eventually she made her way to Los Angeles with important time spent in Austin, Texas and Savannah, Ga. The name she chose, Bedouine, reflects the traveler, the wanderer in her.\n\nFor her first album, she teamed up with the folks from the Richmond, Va. label Spacebomb. Trey Pollard arranged some stunning subtly on her 2017 self-titled album. You may know his work from Natalie Prass, or maybe the music he wrote for the podcast S-Town. Matthew E. White, the label's founder and also a musician signed Bedouine to Spacebomb, and the album was produced by Gus Seyffert. And though I deeply love the album's sound, I was entranced by Azniv Korkejian's solo performance at my desk.

The group's debut album, IIII+IIII, is a fresh electronic take on tradition that's winning over even the most devout practitioners of the western African-based spiritual ceremonies that form the base of their music. That's hard to do with ritual music.\n\nFor their turn behind the Tiny Desk, Otura Mun and his ensemble unplug their drums for their first tune, an acoustic version of their \"House of Love (Ogbe Yekun)\". The sound of the second song here is what startled me when I heard the band's debut CD last year: the parts normally performed on Afro-Cuban bata drums and chekeres are electronically treated for a traditional prayer for the deity Oduduwa. By the last tune, \"Bangah (Pico Y Palo),\" the electronics have created a sonic playground that plays perfectly against the battery of Afro-Cuban rhythms.\n\nListen for the explainer during the performance by Otura Mun, who also gives a shout out to those struggling against the vestiges of colonialism still prevalent in Puerto Rico.\n\nRead Alt.Latino's ÌFÉ primer.\n\nSet List\n\n\"House of Love (Ogbe Yekun)\"\n\"Prayer for Oduduwa (Para Meceditas)\"\n\"Bangah (Pico y Palo)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nOtura Mun (vocals/percussion); Beho Torrens (vocals/percussion); Rafael Maya (vocals/percussion); Anthony Siera (vocals/percussion); Yaimir Cabám (vocals/guitar/percussion)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Bronson Arcuri; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Bronson Arcuri, Maia Stern, Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6s_ZL8b3GE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6s_ZL8b3GE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6s_ZL8b3GE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6s_ZL8b3GE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6s_ZL8b3GE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":28,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Q6s_ZL8b3GE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Luj2gyq4AqkdcL4pbyrRBWk1E_Q\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjJJWWVBRVQ4NnBj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-27T15:44:24.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Meet The 2018 Tiny Desk Contest Community","description":"When we started the Tiny Desk Contest in 2014, we did it because we love discovering new artists.

In addition to the 20-plus inflatable whales they provided, the band requested via email that we provide \"7 x Crunchy apples, 7 x cans of Coca Cola (or similar, as long as they are 330mls/12oz cans it doesn't matter).\" They added, \"PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A RIDER BUT PART OF THE PERFORMANCE.\"\n\nWhen the seven members of the band arrived and huddled behind my desk, they blew into straws, making percussive noises, used toy cars and radios for sound effects and added lots of handclaps. And in the midst of it all was Orono Noguchi, a small-framed, self-described \"average 17-year old Japanese girl living in Maine.\" (That's from an email she wrote me last year).

Here at the Tiny Desk, the saxophonist revisits that history with four remarkable songs from the album, all performed with a hope that our country's future will be less painful than its past.\n\n\"The thing for me is not being afraid to firmly stand on the shoulders of our forefathers, the ones that paved the way for us.\" Richardson told NPR after the performance. \"I'd like this music to be an accumulation of everything involved with the historic tradition of jazz music, black American music, improvised music or whatever you want to call it.\"\n\nYou can hear what Richardson means on the opening song, \"80's Child,\" a reflection on the decade Richardson was born. Its colorful melody complements the band's energetic fusion groove. Continually pushing forward with momentum and anticipation, its 8/8 time signature moves seamlessly into 10/8 to create an intensity that is both focused and free.\n\nThe next groove, \"The Settlement,\" maintains a similar tone and features DeAndre Manning slapping on his funky bass. The song gently segues into the only vocal piece, \"Black Brown & Yellow,\" a lovely reminder that racial diversity is something to celebrate.\n\n\"Anthem (To Human Justice)\" ends with brilliance best described by my colleague Nate Chinen, \"By design, too, Richardson's alto saxophone often functions more like a lead vocalist than as a virtuoso solo instrument.

Marked by loops sourced from jazz recordings and lyrics rooted in one-upmanship, O.C's two '90s albums, Word...Life and Jewelz established him as a rapper's rapper, an underground star.\n\nO.C. was joined at his Tiny Desk by Soul'D U Out, a jazz ensemble led by Grammy-winning trumpeter Maurice \"Mobetta\" Brown. The live instrumentation replicated the sample-heavy original recordings perfectly. The crew kicked off the concert with \"New Day,\" from O.C.'s 2017 album Same Moon Same Sun, which features young R&B singer Tay Bell on the hook.\n\nThe rest of the set was vintage cuts from O.C.'s heyday. \"Day One,\" a D.I.T.C. posse cut, featured emcee and producer Lord Finesse, and the joy that poured forth during his verse belied its level of difficulty. (It reminded me that it'd been too long since I enjoyed a Lord Finesse album.) Then O.C. treated the crowd to a version of \"Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers\" (the one and only song by him, Jeru The Damaja and Chubb Rock). And of course, he had to fit in his seminal banger and arguably most popular song, \"Time's Up,\" from Word...Life.\n\nThe finale got personal when O.C. relayed the importance of the song \"Born 2 Live.\" \"This is dedicated to a friend of mine who got killed down in Baltimore,\" he said. \"Everytime I do this record, it's somber. ... But it's a celebration at the same time. So I'm a just party it out and have a good time with it.\" With a little help from Soul'D U Out, we did, too.\n\nSET LIST\n\"New Day\"\n\"Day One\"\n\"Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers\"\n\"Time's Up\"\n\"Born 2 Live\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nOmar \"O.C.\" Credle (emcee), Robert \"Lord Finesse\" Hall (emcee), Maurice \"Mobetta\" Brown (trumpet), Chris Rob (keys/vocals), Marcus Machado (guitar), Parker McAllister (bass), Camau \"Klutch\" Bernstine (drums), Tay Bell (vocals)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Beck Harlan, Dani Lyman; Production Assistants: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05EW61wUoLU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05EW61wUoLU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05EW61wUoLU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05EW61wUoLU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05EW61wUoLU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":34,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"05EW61wUoLU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/FVNtr21jRegRnhSAoVQ1uF58sCk\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkNITVpXOWtMcGcw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-23T09:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"The Breeders: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"April 16, 2018 | Lars Gotrich -- After many iterations, hiatuses and returns, The Breeders will always be Kim Deal's band, with her sister Kelley at her side. They return this year to an old lineup, with all the promise (and old wounds) it brings. But you can see a renewed love and goofiness throughout this set — using a roadie as a crash cymbal, or Kim Deal's faux-exasperation at Josephine Wiggs for starting a wind-up toy just before a song.\n\nThe same group behind the band's breakout, 1993 Last Splash — a sugar-smacked, alt-pop album that sounded like nothing else in the underground pushed to rock radio — just released All Nerve in March. Now bassist Wiggs and drummer Jim Macpherson join Kim and Kelley Deal for this Tiny Desk Concert.\n\n\"Somehow, between the four of us getting in the basement [and] playing together again, it all just felt exactly the same as the good times before everything,\" Kelley Deal told NPR. \"It was just really fun.\"\n\nThe new songs don't have the same punch as Last Splash; rather, they are wizened, frazzled and, with a generous mix of crunch and dreamy scuzz, explore themes of encroaching isolation and dissatisfaction. The Breeders play two songs from All Nerve — the lysergic \"MetaGoth\" and the gorgeously strange and sweet title track — plus \"Off You\" from 2002's Title TK, an excellent album worth revisiting if you haven't listened in a while. It's a reminder that, while you can hear the raw charm of The Breeders in younger bands, no one still quite sounds like them.\n\nSET LIST\n\"MetaGoth\"\n\"All Nerve\"\n\"Off You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKim Deal (guitar, bass vocals), Kelley Deal (guitar, bass, vocals), Josephine Wiggs (guitar, bass, vocals), Jim Macpherson (drums)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Lars Gotrich, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CHMZW9kLpg0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CHMZW9kLpg0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CHMZW9kLpg0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CHMZW9kLpg0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CHMZW9kLpg0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":35,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"CHMZW9kLpg0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/dSqEQZeidYZ0kkFaSga5zpcKzJo\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnFuNnJnaXNabTFN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-20T09:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Jorge Drexler: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"April 13, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Jorge Drexler is a poet with a gift for song. The Uruguayan singer-songwriter, like the iconic Latin American lyricists of the past (Mercedes Sosa, Victor Jara and Silvio Rodriguez, to name just a few), has that rare ability to surround multi-layered prose with music that lends an even deeper resonance to the words.\n\nDrexler has his share of fans here in the U.S., mostly Latin American expats and others whose grasp of the language allows them to appreciate the nuances of his storytelling. But, as if often the case with music performed in languages other than English, audiences here sometimes miss out on an emotional connection with artists they would otherwise celebrate if they only knew what they were singing.\n\nSo, we decided to do something about that with Jorge Drexler's appearance at the Tiny Desk. With the cooperation of the artist, we translated Drexler's thoughtful and playful ruminations on the human condition, and included them as subtitles.\n\nThose clever lyrics wouldn't hit as hard if not for Drexler's backing band of magicians. The mix of guitarists and percussionists conjured a stunning cloud of sound that allowed Drexler to take flight, like the existential dreamer that he is.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Movimiento\"\n\"Silencio\"\n\"Asilo\"\n\"Telefonia\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJorge Drexler - Vocals and Guitar\nJavier Zarember - Guitar and backing vocals\nMartín Leiton - Leona, guitarrón, bass and backing vocals\nCarles \"Campi\" Campon - Electronic beats, acoustic guitar, percussion and backing vocals\nBorja Barrueta - Drums, percussion and Backing Vocals\nMartin Cella- Guitar, backing vocals, percussion\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Beck Harlan, Dani Lyman; Production Assistants: Joshua Bote, Stefanie Fernández; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qn6rgisZm1M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qn6rgisZm1M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qn6rgisZm1M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qn6rgisZm1M/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qn6rgisZm1M/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":36,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qn6rgisZm1M"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/QibGBZY-oT7D466aiZR5Hmjy9hQ\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnp2MEp1dHRUdTVz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-13T13:31:49.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Desks Of The 2018 Tiny Desk Contest","description":"Every Tiny Desk Contest video has to feature a desk, and we've seen all kinds of desks in this year's Contest: Some are big, some are tiny, some are standard desks, and some are... definitely not.

The sound is warm and velvety, all the instruments gently pulsing, as Mike Milosh softly sings with that high-pitched yearn.\n\nTiny Desk Concerts are often awkward by nature — bands playing in the middle of an office in the daytime for musicians used to playing in the evening, with stage lighting. But there was a special transformation that took place at this Tiny Desk the moment the music kicked in.

That was our 500th performance at the Tiny Desk, with Dan playing alongside his band The Arcs.\n\nThis time out, we have a different kind of celebration — and an explosion of talent — as Dan brings his Easy Eye Sound Revue to the Tiny Desk. It's an abundance of gifted musicians who have all played with a long, long list of legends, including Elvis, Don Williams and John Prine. Their set recalls a time and sound from the '60s when southern R&B, including Nashville, was a force.\n\nMidway through the four-song set (that includes tunes from his 2017 album Waiting on a Song), Dan introduces a powerhouse: the seasoned but relatively unknown blues-and-soul singer Robert Finley. The husky voiced gentleman, with a giant smile and magical charisma, is heart-winning and heart-warming. It's remarkable that this legally blind singer is only now getting the attention he deserves. Hopefully this inspires you to go digging to hear the album Robert Finley and Dan Auerbach released at the end of 2017 called Goin' Platinum.\n\nFor those of you who saw the recent Tiny Desk Concert from fellow Nashville musician John Prine, you may remember John telling tales of writing songs with Pat McLaughlin in the morning, going to town for some meatloaf and then recording the song by day's end. Well that's Pat on the mandolin here in this Tiny Desk set. His playing is both astonishing and low-key. The small band for this stripped-down version of the \"Revue\" is fleshed with Dante Schwebel on guitar and Russ Pahl's resonator guitar sounds.\n\nDan Auerbach is a master of ceremonies, a community maker and a great songwriter. His world is one where it's hard to tell if this pool of talent has gathered around to join Dan, or if he's managed to reconnect some old magic in hopes of going along for a great ride himself. Either way we win.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Waiting On a Song\"\n\"Never In My Wildest Dreams\"\n\"Get It While You Can feat.

Now, a gorgeous 67 years young, Bridgewater is connecting openly with her roots, her birthplace and the town she's loved all her life.\n\nWhen she was just three years old, her family moved from Memphis, Tennessee, to Flint, Michigan. Years later, Bridgewater could still hear the soul sounds of Memphis on WDIA, the first radio station in America programmed entirely by African-Americans for African-Americans. She recalled, \"I could catch it when I was in Flint as a teenager and I would listen to it after 11:00 at night, because that was the only time I could get it — when all the other stations were off the air. I know it was real, 'cause I went through it and these were all songs I heard on WDIA.\"\n\nBridgewater brought three of these songs to the Tiny Desk: First, is the celebrated blues hit, \"Hound Dog,\" first recorded by not by Elvis Presley but by Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton in 1952. What makes this presentation special is not only Bridgewater's sultry and soulful interpretation, but her adorable Daisy, perhaps the cutest \"Hound Dog\" to ever bless this song.\n\nThe first lines of the next tune will quite actually send chills down your spine. Bridgewater and backup singers Sharisse Norman and Shontelle Norman-Beatty's close harmonic voicings add a spiritual dimension to the already hallowed song. \"Why (Am I Treated So Bad)?\" was written by Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples in response to the harassment of the Little Rock Nine, brave students who decided they had the right to attend an all-white Arkansas high school in 1957.\n\nLast here is \"B.A.B.Y.\" Bridgewater recorded this song and the entire album in Memphis' historic Royal Studios and told NPR this story, \"I stepped outside of the studio right after they started mixing 'B.A.B.Y.' and I said a prayer. I said, 'God I need a sign, that I'm moving in the right direction because I am completely stepping completely away from jazz music.'\" Before Bridgewater could get back into the studio to record the next track she got a surprise visit from Carla Thomas, the Memphis soul queen herself and daughter of Rufus Thomas, influential entertainer, singer-songwriter and former WDIA radio DJ. It was a true return to her Memphis roots, a memorable and beautiful moment for Bridgewater.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Hound Dog\" (Jerry Leiber & Mike Stoller)\n\n\"Why (Am I Treated So Bad)?\" (Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples)\n\n\"B.A.B.Y.\" (Isaac Lee Hayes & David Porter)\nDee Dee Bridgewater's latest album, Memphis...

It's not real. We hope you enjoyed it.\n\nApril 1, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- \"Not all pianists are created in equal temperament,\" Robin Olson told a small but enthusiastic audience behind NPR Music's storied Tiny Desk. The pianist, hailed as an \"avant-garde gewandhaus\" by Berlin's Staubzeitung, is as celebrated for his cryptic maxims as he is for his inscrutable music.\n\nOlson's trademark style — shooting clusters of shimmering chords and solitary, pearlescent pitches into reverberant space — has led him to exalted concert halls and to work with a broad array of stars such as Yuja Wang, Aretha Franklin, Chick Corea and Emanuel Ax.\n\nDrawing from the seminal Plink technique, cultivated among the Schlammstadt School of composers in the 1950s, Olson is regarded as a leading technician of the more expansive Neo-Plink style. \"Intervals have coincident partials,\" Olson explains. \"They create a form of dissonance, called 'beats,' by which pitches are set for optimum harmonicity.\"\n\nFrom a bulging briefcase, Olson pulls out any number tools to alter specific pitches, as in his opening piece, \"A 440.\" He threads ribbons of felt between piano strings to mimic the muted cries of the Asian dung beetle in \"The Temperament,\" from his 2014 collection Infinite Chasms.\n\nOlson surprised everyone at the Tiny Desk by debuting a new piece, \"Tuning the Bass,\" wherein his inventive command of the instrument's lower register highlighted spaces between keening dark octaves.\n\nHe may be considered a challenging artist, but Olson, through the essential humanity of his performance, reveals the efforts of almost any other living pianist to be little more than a joke.\n\nSet List\n\n\"A 440\"\n\"The Temperament\"\n\"Tuning the Bass\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Tom Huizenga, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Jenna Sterner/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uQAQg7F89DY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uQAQg7F89DY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uQAQg7F89DY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uQAQg7F89DY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uQAQg7F89DY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":46,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"uQAQg7F89DY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/L_eDN2p9dIOEvXO5952bxXej1dc\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnluZzVDVFQ4T2dr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-02T13:00:06.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Jenny and the Mexicats: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"March 26, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Jenny and the Mexicats is a discovery from South by Southwest a few years ago that I haven't been able to get out of my mind, and with good reason: The band's high energy shows are unforgettable, as is its sound. Mixing flamenco, originally from southern Spain, with Jenny Ball's jazz trumpet background and a little bit of cumbia has created their one-of-a-kind musical identity.\n\nThe grooves these musicians create can be frenetic (as in the first performance here, \"Frenético Ritmo\") or slow and luxurious (\"The Song for the UV Mouse House\"). In both cases, the group presents the perfect cushion for Ball's impassioned singing and engaging stage presence. There are no weak points in the instrumentation, and with Ball out front, the songs come to life as the short stories they are — like that of the young lady who appreciates a beer before taking on life's challenges in \"Verde Más Allá.\"\n\nWatching this performance, it's easy to see why Jenny and the Mexicats is picking up new fans as the group travels the world spreading its good cheer.

After a little more than two decades, no one can really imitate his complex cool.\n\nSporting a pair of sunglasses (always), Oyamada recently brought his band from Japan to the Tiny Desk on a rare U.S. tour, including his longtime collaborator and former Pizzicato Five member Hiroshisa Horie, drummer Yuko Araki (Mi-Gu, Cibo Mato's live band) and synthesist Yumiko Matsumura (Buffalo Daughter). They're all musicians who tease and poke at music's fringe territory, but still know how to make a song buzz and pop with gleeful curiosity.\n\nHere, Cornelius performs three very different songs from last year's Mellow Waves. There's the robotic groove of \"Helix/Spiral,\" which repeats and mutates the same phrase and melodic fragments in a delicate and strange dance. \"In a Dream\" is a star-swept landscape that invites the subconscious to search for meaning, its keyboard flourishes and light acoustic strums so breezy you could almost call it a kind of retro-futuristic yacht rock. But set closer \"If You're Here\" is the real marvel to behold live, as the band performs at different tempos, gradually solving a polyrhythmic puzzle of a slow jam.

In the video here, you'll see Richter himself on keyboards and electronics, along with the ACME string ensemble and soprano vocalist Grace Davidson, surrounded by those snoozing listeners.

John Prine is a truly legendary songwriter. For more than 45 years the 71-year-old artist has written some of the most powerful lyrics in the American music canon, including \"Sam Stone,\" \"Angel From Montgomery,\" \"Hello In There\" and countless others.\n\nJohn Prine's new songs are equally powerful and he opens this Tiny Desk concert with \"Caravan of Fools,\" a track he wrote with Pat McLaughlin and Dan Auerbach. Prine adds a disclaimer to the song saying, \"any likeness to the current administration is purely accidental.\" That song, and his second tune, the sweet tearjerker \"Summer's End,\" are from John Prine's first album of new songs in 13 years, The Tree of Forgiveness, produced by Dave Cobb. It was recorded with his longtime band in Nashville's legendary RCA Studio A. Guests include Brandi Carlile, Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires. There's even a songwriter's co-credit with Phil Spector.\n\nFor this Tiny Desk Concert John Prine also reaches back to his great \"kiss-off\" song from 1991 called \"All the Best,\" and then plays \"Souvenirs,\" a song intended for his debut full-length but released the following year on his 1972 album Diamonds in the Rough. It's just one of the many sentimental ballads Prine has gifted us. Over the years, his voice has become gruffer and deeper, due in part to his battle with squamous cell cancer on the right side of his neck, all of which makes this song about memories slipping by feel all the more powerful and sad.\n\n\"Broken hearts and dirty windows\nMake life difficult to see\nThat's why last night and this mornin'\nAlways look the same to me\nI hate reading old love letters\nFor they always bring me tears\nI can't forgive the way they rob me\nOf my sweetheart's souvenirs\"\n\nJohn Prine's latest album, The Tree Of Forgiveness, is due out April 13 on Oh Boy Records.

I inevitably end up discovering so much wonderful music while going through the submissions.\n\nLast year I came across Kuinka (coo-WINK-uh), a band from Seattle, and fell in love. So, when we held a Tiny Desk party in Seattle last May, with our partner station KEXP, we invited Kuinka (and other local bands) to play. Kuinka's live performance knocked me out even more than the creative video they'd submitted for the contest.\n\nSince then, Brothers Zach and Nathan Hamer, along with Miranda Zickler and Jillian Walker, have come to D.C. for an official performance at the Tiny Desk, bringing with them their great harmonies and unique blend of energetic, string-band music with a dose of synth.\n\nThe songs are performed here on relatively tiny instruments, including a ukulele, a drum pad, a small synth, a mandolin and a banjo, along with an electric guitar. But the performance is fleshed out beautifully with rousing vocal harmonies.\n\nAll three tracks performed here are from Kuinka's 2017 EP Stay Up Late, and each one has its own charm. Make sure you stay to the end because \"Mistakenly Brave\" is the most stirring of the bunch.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Curious Hands\"\n\"Spaces\"\n\"Mistakenly Brave\"\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Beck Harlan, Dani Lyman; Editor: Beck Harlan; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":62,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"kWg2nMJkO5Y"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/EVv8qeYRVQcf7aSxBNwm4BJpRlY\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlkyTjlSOUNERVpr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-14T13:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Alex Clare: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"March 7, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Even before The Beatles recorded their own version of \"Twist and Shout,\" British fascination with American soul music has run deep. Vocalist and songwriter Alex Clare is yet another soul disciple from the UK, and his visit to Bob Boilen's desk is the perfect setting to bask in the power of his voice.\n\nClare has made a lot of noise in relatively little time, having released his first album in 2011. For a variety of reasons, he was not able to capitalize on the strength of his debut and lost his record deal — but after Microsoft picked up one of his songs for an international ad campaign, he was soon back in the studio.\n\nThe first song in this Tiny Desk performance, \"Three Hearts,\" is a love song dedicated to the moment he heard the heartbeat of his first child coming from his wife's sonogram. Backed by a tight four-piece band, Clare's tale of his family's road to domestic tranquility captures the joy as well as the uncertainty of impending parenthood. In the song \"Caroline,\" he inhabits the words with passion and heartfelt pleading, bringing to mind some of the best soul shouters, completely lost in the sentiment of the lyric.\n\nClare's personal story of a spiritual dedication to Judaism touches everything he writes, and as his career has professed, he has continued to produce songs that ask us to probe our own emotions through the lens life's bigger pictures. His Tiny Desk Concert is a glimpse at a musician capturing all of that complexity in a performance steeped in the passion of soul, one that mesmerizes and inspires at the same time.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Three Hearts\"\n\"Love Can Heal\"\n\"Caroline\"\n\"Open My Eyes\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAlex Clare (vocals), Jordan Peters (guitarist), Christopher Hargreaves (bass), Chris Prendergast (drums)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, CJ Riculan; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y2N9R9CDEZk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y2N9R9CDEZk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y2N9R9CDEZk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y2N9R9CDEZk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y2N9R9CDEZk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":63,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Y2N9R9CDEZk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/3um7vIN1KirNxqwIL2rbyRViFW0\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnJxWGZ2Z05CUzZB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-08T22:43:26.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Announcing The 2018 Tiny Desk Contest: Meet H Hog and the Grumps","description":"Want to play a Tiny Desk concert at NPR Music?

Especially not when they bear as much influence on your life as Big K.R.I.T.'s grandmother has on his. The Mississippi spitter has kept her spirit alive through his music since his breakout mixtape, K.R.I.T. Wuz Here, which he released the same year she passed in 2010.\n\nSo it only makes sense that he would bring her with him for his Tiny Desk concert.\n\nHalfway through his three-song set at NPR Music headquarters, K.R.I.T. stops to pull out an old-school tape recorder — the same one his grandmother would use to record him singing and reciting poetry as a child. \"I have to feel like my grandmother was my first mix engineer,\" he says before pressing play to reveal he and his brother as kids singing a duet of R&B crooner Donell Jones' 1999 slow burner, \"Where I Wanna Be.\"\n\nIt's a sublime interlude — one that resonated so strongly with K.R.I.T. that he had to start his last song, \"Bury Me In Gold,\" over to catch the proper beat. \"I'm super emotional from this, too,\" he says, laughing in a moment so genuine it was only right to leave it unedited.\n\nK.R.I.T.'s Tiny Desk came on the heels of 4eva Is a Mighty Long Time, a double album in which he covers everything from blessings to depression while plumbing the carnal and spiritual depths of his own duality. All three songs performed here come from side two, titled after his birth name Justin Scott, as his grandmother refers to him on the cassette tape.\n\nHer voice isn't the only special guest in the building. K.R.I.T.'s backing band, which includes Burniss Travis II on bass and Justin Tyson on drums, also features on keys Bryan Michael Cox — the hitmaking producer and songwriter behind a slew of Billboard chart-toppers (Mariah Carey, Usher, Mary J. Blige). Together, the trio delivers stripped-down versions of the latest thought-provoking material in Big K.R.I.T.'s catalog. And when he stops to pay homage to his church-going grandmother before performing \"Keep The Devil Off,\" it's clear that everything she instilled in him is keeping him alive, too.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Mixed Messages\"\n\"Keep The Devil Off\"\n\"Bury Me In Gold\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBig K.R.I.T.

The instrumentation is unusual, with pulsing bass sounds produced by a wonderful combination of cello, tuba and electronics. It's all rhythmically propelled by an astonishing drummer and Meredith pounding a pair of floor toms. And much of the repetitive melody is keyboard-and-guitar-driven that morphs and erupt with earth-shaking fervor.\n\nI first saw this British composer a year ago, in a stunning performance at the SXSW musical festival. It was one of the best concerts of my life. The music I heard sent me into a state of reverie. If music could levitate my body, this is how it would sound. It carried me away and thrilled my soul. I was giddy for days.\n\nNow, I know this isn't music for everyone. Lovers of classical music might shun it for its use of sequencers and electronics. The electronic world may wonder how the hell you could ever dance to this. Or for lovers of rock and hip-hop, its repetition and throbbing beats and bass might send you running and screaming into the distance. But if you know and love the music of Philip Glass, King Crimson or Steve Reich — music that's electrifying, challenging and sonically soars and ripples through your body — then crank this up.\n\nAnna Meredith was a former BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra Composer in Residence. The songs performed here come from her 2016 release called Varmints, which is where two of the three songs performed here can be found. It's been a long while since a contemporary composer has captured my musical imagination. I hope and trust this will open many to a new way of thinking about what music is and what it can do.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Nautilus\"\n\"Ribbons\"\n\"The Vapours\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAnna Meredith, Jack Ross, Tom Kelly, Sam Wilson, Maddie Cutter\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Beck Harlan, Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/36FNJiP8GWk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/36FNJiP8GWk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/36FNJiP8GWk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/36FNJiP8GWk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/36FNJiP8GWk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":66,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"36FNJiP8GWk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/9syH8OOYD3EOMQaCF-jkByJcfMo\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkNnaEs4aVZVSEJz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-08T14:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Roy Ayers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"March 1, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- Roy Ayers arrived at his Tiny Desk performance beaming with positivity. The 77-year-old funk icon and vibraphonist sauntered through the office with a Cheshire grin on his face, sharing jokes with anyone within earshot. Accompanying him was a trio of brilliantly seasoned musicians — keyboardist Mark Adams, bassist Trevor Allen and drummer Christopher De Carmine. Later during the performance, pride washed across Ayers' face as his bandmates took the spotlight. (Be sure to watch as Adams woos not just the room but brightens Ayers' face during his solo.)\n\nThe set began with one of Ayers' more recognizable hits: an extended version of \"Searching,\" a song that embodies the eternal quest for peace and love. During \"Black Family\" (from his 1983 album Lots Of Love), you'll hear him call out \"Fela\" throughout. That's because Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti was a huge influence on Ayers in the late 1970s; the two eventually collaborated on an album, 1980's Music Of Many Colors. \"Black Family\" is, in part, a tribute to Fela, even if the original version didn't include his name.\n\nConcluding this mini-concert, Ayers closed the set out with his signature tune, \"Everybody Loves the Sunshine\", a feel-good ode if there ever was one.

Her 2017 record, The Lonely, The Lonesome & The Gone, evokes the country music of Womack's Texas upbringing as the daughter of a country radio DJ, name-checking Hank Williams and covering George Jones.\n\nAt the Tiny Desk, the emotional storytelling and unparalleled vocal ability that anchor the album are all the more immediate. No bystander was impervious to the stormy and soaring \"All The Trouble,\" and the affecting lyrics of \"Mama Lost Her Smile\" felt even more intimate and unguarded when performed just feet from the audience. \"That's just good old country music story songs,\" she explained.\n\nSteeped in tradition but singular in its expression, Womack's timeless performance tapped into the emotional core of country, and transcended our cluttered office space in the process.\n\nSET LIST\n\"All the Trouble\"\n\"Mama Lost Her Smile\"\n\"Hollywood\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLee Ann Womack (vocals), Luke Bulla (fiddle and background vocals), Dave Dunseath (drums and background vocals), Jonathan Trebing (guitar), Lex Price (bass)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Beck Harlan, Maia Stern; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDRd0CEneOU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDRd0CEneOU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDRd0CEneOU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDRd0CEneOU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDRd0CEneOU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":68,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"kDRd0CEneOU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/CiGqGwQ-rEqcXeP3SaZGwHqYERE\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlpQdVUzOS1QWWpR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-02T14:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Vagabon: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Feb. 23, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Laetitia Tamko, the artist known as Vagabon, is a 25-year-old, Cameroon-born musician with a big, tenor voice just bursting with new musical ideas. I've seen her as a solo artist, with a band and, here at the Tiny Desk, both solo and with a bassist.\n\nHer pride shines bright in her smile and as well it should. For someone self-taught and who's been playing for only the past four years, her arrangements are adept and thoughtful in an independent rock music scene that can often be lyrically lazy and texturally tepid.\n\nVagabon's poetry speaks to love. You can hear it in \"Cold Apartment.\" While she closes the Tiny Desk set with it, it was the first song she ever wrote and one that came to her during a difficult time in her life.\n\n\"And we sat on my cold apartment floor\nWhere we thought we would stay in love\nStay in love\"\n\nThough all the songs here are about love, Vagabon also speaks proudly to black women on her 2017 album, Infinite Worlds. There aren't a lot of black women in this bedroom studio community of independents, a community that, especially in New York, has welcomed her and where she mostly found stimulus and guidance.\n\nWe were also treated to a new song during this Tiny Desk performance called \"Full Moon In Gemini,\" which, coincidentally, was performed on the day of a total lunar eclipse in Leo - she warned us all to \"watch yourselves.\"\n\nOne of the attractions for me as I curate artists to perform behind my office desk, is to bring budding talent to the fore.

It was during that unprecedented performance that the then-untitled ensemble premiered the powerful \"Letter to the Free,\" an original song for Ava DuVernay's Netflix documentary 13th that eventually won an Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.\n\nFor the trio's first visit to NPR headquarters, they brought some special guests: vocalists Brandy, Maimouna Youssef and Andra Day. The band performed four tracks from its upcoming self-titled album (out March 9 on Amazon Music), an impromptu freestyle, and Day's Oscar-nominated collaboration with Common, \"Stand Up For Something,\" from the film Marshall. Common described the theme of the Tiny Desk as \"Foregrounding Women,\" alluding to the attendance of Brandy, Day and Youssef, as well as the spiritual presence of Glasper's younger cousin, Loren, who passed just a few days prior.\n\nThe past year has been a pivotal time for women, between #MeToo and social and financial equality, and the lyrics to these songs frame women's contemporary frustrations as civil rights issues. That's important in hip-hop, which has long been dogged by an old-line adherence to misogyny, as it lays claim to the world's most popular genre.\n\nIn a spontaneous moment midway through Maimouna Youssef's verse on \"Practice,\" the crowd gushed and you could see the joy in her eyes. Then the ebullient pop icon Brandy reprised Sounds Of Blackness' 1991 classic \"Optimistic,\" and the magic held everyone rapt. Andra Day followed up with \"Stand Up for Something\"; her powerful voice blew the hinges off the doors.\n\nAugust Greene's latest single, \"Black Kennedy,\" connotes dreams of an African-American dynasty, the kind only a royal family assumes. The stark contrasts of disenfranchisement are highlighted by every wish expressed. Later, in \"Let Go,\" vocalist and August Greene collaborator Samora Pinderhughes sings of overcoming darkness within yourself and finding hope at the bottom of Pandora's box. It's about releasing the demons so the hands can hold the blessings.\n\nAugust Greene is what happens when talent embraces intention and humility. This edition of the Tiny Desk inspired me, its audience, and the artists behind the stage. We hope it has the same effect on you.\n\nSET LIST\n• \"Black Kennedy\" (feat.

The music's roots extend to the Venezuelan slave trade, and while the vocals are in Spanish and not an African dialect, the instruments the group plays date back more than 500 years.\n\nThe large bamboo cylinders, the djembe-like drums and the large friction drum together create a symphony of interlocking polyrhythms that was unlike anything I'd heard. Machado's vocals soar over the unrelenting rhythms, and when she harmonizes with the other singers, it creates a choir-like display of African call-and-response vocals.\n\nWhen discussing African-influenced music from the southern hemisphere, we often focus on countries like Brazil and Cuba, places where the folk music eventually made its way into popular music. Afro-Venezuelan culture and music is rarely featured or even acknowledged outside of the country. As you'll see in this video, that should change once music fans take in the beauty of Machado's voice and the power of her historical message.\n\nSET LIST\n• \"Oh, Santa Rosa\"\n\n• \"Alaé Alaó\"\n\n• \"Sentimiento\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBetsayda Machado, Nereida Machado, Youse Cardozo, Blanca Castilo, Adrian \"Ote\" Gomez, Jose Gomez, Oscar Ruiz.\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, Alyse Young; Editor: Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki, Josephine Nyounai; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W8SnRPbiGH8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W8SnRPbiGH8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W8SnRPbiGH8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W8SnRPbiGH8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W8SnRPbiGH8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":71,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"W8SnRPbiGH8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/2646YA9TiInGf-cuDDfAMiZ9B8o\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnA4VXcxY2w0eGpn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-26T14:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Big Daddy Kane: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Feb. 19, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- One of the greatest to ever bless the mic, Big Daddy Kane treated Tiny Desk to an office block party in the true essence of hip-hop. He performed a short set of classics, including \"Smooth Operator,\" \"Ain't No Half Steppin',\" \"Raw\" and a bonus freestyle. Through his warm, engaging and devilishly self-effacing style, the pioneer used an interlude between songs to address the intergenerational divisiveness defining rap today and the importance of fans of all ages supporting whatever they like, while \"focusing on what's positive and keeping that in the spotlight.\"\n\nKane, aka Dark Gable, was a breakout member of the seminal Juice Crew in hip-hop's golden era during the latter part of the 1980s. He popularized quick-cadence flows and multisyllabic rhyme schemes before passing the torch to early mentees like Jay-Z. Many a night during my adolescence was spent trying to memorize the baritone MC's lyrics. During those sessions, I could only feel sympathy for the subpar MCs who fell victim to the \"Wrath of Kane.\"\n\nThe smooth operator, Big Daddy Kane, still emits that same palpable swag he did as a lyrical heartthrob during his heyday. He strides into the room and fully commands it with his presence. And now that hip-hop is the most popular genre, with its biggest stars wielding global influence, it's important to us here at Tiny Desk to continue to make room for the legends who laid the foundation before the whole world became hip. Long live the Kane.\n\nSET LIST\n• \"Raw\"\n\n• \"Smooth Operator\"\n\n• \"Ain't No Half Steppin\"\n\n• \"Freestyle\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAntonio Hardy, Matt Lambert, Benjamin Geis, Judson Nelson, John Williams\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Alyse Young; Assistant Editor: Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8Uw1cl4xjg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8Uw1cl4xjg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8Uw1cl4xjg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8Uw1cl4xjg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8Uw1cl4xjg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":72,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"p8Uw1cl4xjg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/N5EbwIiPOFdLF9rbKQAXRUhyeuU\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLk44M0Q4S1VlQ3Fz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-21T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Nick Hakim: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Feb. 14, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The music of Nick Hakim occupies a space and time that is faintly out of this world. The guitars and machinery that make up his music feel slightly askew, as though someone slowed down the tape machine every once in a while. His raspy voice feels drenched in a cavernous space. In fact, the first time I met Nick Hakim, he was literally draped in fiber optics, as if stars were surrounding him. That was in Austin at SXSW's Optic Obscura installation.\n\nBut here at the Tiny Desk, in Nick Hakim's hometown of Washington D.C., it was daylight at our office and all pretty down-to-earth, with guitars, bass, drums, piano and a touch of electronics behind my desk. Yet, with his voice unamplified and stripped of the reverb he's come to rely on, Nick Hakim's music still felt warm and spacious.\n\nThe songs he performed are from his 2017 record, Green Twins. The tune he opens with is an exploration of memory, of sex and love as he sings, \"It's been years since you came around to these parts of my mind / All I can recall is you restin' naked every time.\"\n\nExploring the quietude of inner thoughts seems to be a theme floating through Nick Hakim's music. And in the broad daylight of this Tiny Desk, his talent for lyricism and tamed passion, along with his band's playful restraint, reshaped these songs in ways that feel more accessible and less obtuse. So here's your chance to discover someone who may be new to you, with the hope you'll explore Nick Hakim's recorded work.\n\nSET LIST\n\n• \"Cuffed\"\n\n• \"Needy Bees\"\n\n• \"Roller Skates\"\n\nMusicians\n\nNick Hakim (vocals and guitar), Kyle Miles (bass), Jake Sherman (keys), Joe Harrison (guitar), Vishal Nayak (drums)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young, Maia Stern; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N83D8KUeCqs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N83D8KUeCqs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N83D8KUeCqs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N83D8KUeCqs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N83D8KUeCqs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":73,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"N83D8KUeCqs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/M_uvhI8WHcdGeCBOYPmUxG1SUuk\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLng5bW1BVHF4U2pR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-08T22:42:55.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Announcing The 2018 Tiny Desk Contest: Meet Yung Hedge","description":"Want to play a Tiny Desk concert at NPR Music?

In 2001, on any given Monday night on U Street, music lovers would be treated to a magic show. Bar Nun's open mic night unearthed some of the finest MC's, poets and singers from the area, but they all took a back seat once the Crossrhodes stepped on stage. Week after week, the band passionately performed original material that jumped between society's woes and their own love lives, going from mere contestants to the main attraction. Word eventually spread outside of the D.C. area and one-half of the group, Raheem DeVaughn, landed a record deal.\n\nDeVaughn went on to achieve R&B superstardom, earning two Grammy nominations, while the other half of the group, Wes Felton, has remained a pillar of D.C. culture, excelling as both a musician and actor. They reunited and released their first album in over a decade last year. Footprints on the Moon recapitulates and magnifies the ideals they conveyed in the early 2000s with a hyper-focused sense of urgency. There's nothing subliminal about the way they go about; there's no need to guess what side they're on. Representing the misrepresented, their approach is clear and direct.\n\nDraped in black suits, they entered the building with their game faces on. Poet, Raquel Ra Brown eloquently set the tone for the band to completely ravish the desk. The Crossrhodes ripped through 3 and half selections from \"FOTM\" including an emotional rendition of \"Praying Prayers.\"\n\nDeVaughn, notorious for leaving his soul on stages around the world, belts with every ounce of his being while Felton came equipped with a completely reinvigorated flow, delivering bars of the most potent lyrics of his career.\n\nDear Father, I come to you at moment\n\nAs a humble soldier, eye to eye with my opponents\n\nHalf don't know or acknowledge your components\n\nThey don't read your word, even if they own it\n\nThe crowd's subtle intrigue slowly swelled into sheer fandom by the last note, reminiscent of those Bar Nun days.

The sisters, Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Díaz, carry that calling in their DNA, and how they've manifested it into their own art is nothing short of amazing.\n\nAs you see in this video, the twins (Ibeyi means 'twins\" in Yoruban) perform their music with the batá drums associated with Yoruban sacred music and their elaborate vocal arrangements channel the call-and-response of traditional African music. The melding of their voices when they harmonize can be breathtaking, but the same can be said about the messages behind their songs, themes that inspire both inward introspection and celebrations of life.\n\nThe sisters truly have a magic that transcends cultures and languages. I watched them lead a sold-out crowd at Washington D.C.'s 9:30 Club through a Yoruban chant, and it was mind-blowing.

As Soul Captain for Hurray for the Riff Raff, she and her band weave tales of man's inhumanity to fellow humans, often from bigotry, intolerance and ignorance.\n\nBut the spirit that arises out of her ancestral roots and its clash with twenty-first century cultural insensitivities inspires the brilliance that is Hurray For The Riff Raff's latest album, The Navigator. This 2017 release and the songs that grace it are at the heart of the fervency Alynda Segarra sings about so animatedly at the Tiny Desk. The song \"Pa'lante,\" one of the most articulate songs of a generation, speaks of being colonized and hypnotized, sterilized and dehumanized, with the refrain, \"pa'lante\" which translates as \"forward.\" I think of it as \"onward.\" To continue the fight to freedom and respect. As Alynda Segarra preaches:\n\n\"To all who lost their pride, I say, Pa'lante!\nTo all who had to survive, I say, Pa'lante!\nTo my brothers, and my sisters, I say, Pa'lante!\"\n\nWriting songs with a message can often turn out to be well-meaning, but musically less memorable.

From the opening licks of her Tiny Desk set, the eclectic singer-songwriter turned NPR's spacious D.C. headquarters into a Harlem speakeasy.\n\nFor those not familiar, Smith made a big splash among true-school heads in 2006 with the release of her debut album, For Lovers, Dreamers, and Friends. That record, whose title is a play on \"The Rainbow Connection,\" brimmed with an arcane magic, and it created a legion of lifelong fans.\n\nSmith's live performances usually highlight songs from For Lovers, Dreamers, and Friends, her 2013 album, She, and her repertoire of cover songs. But for her Tiny Desk performance, Smith gifted us with three stunning song premieres that left the room entirely in her thrall.\n\nThe first song, \"Mystery,\" feels like walking into the home of that friend of yours who is clearly more worldly than you, where there's always a cool breeze, no matter the season.\n\nThe second song, which is so new that it doesn't have a title, exudes the liminal uneasiness of being out of tune with yourself. The wisdom of the song draws from the notion that the top of Maslow's pyramid is found within.\n\nThe closing \"Something\" is an undulating soul search that attacks and recedes like a cloudy beach morning. Smith was unabashedly in her pocket here, alternating between falsetto, tremolo and touches of jazz.

Listen how her lyricism interplays with the rhythm section's syncopated groove to create a captivating state of emotional buoyancy.\n\nThere is much to savor in Woods' music, rich with philosophical meaning and striking musicality. Of particular note is her recurring theme of self-love, as heard in \"Holy,\" the last song in this set: \"Woke up this morning with my mind set on loving me.\" (What a refreshing affirmation to hear \"loving me,\" instead of the predictable \"loving you.\")\n\n\"My mission as an artist is always to create art that's useful,\" Woods told NPR. \"I want my music to feel like it has a tangible effect on people, like it allows them to check in with themselves, feel affirmed, feel able to continue into their day or into their path with renewed energy and a renewed sense of self, because ... that's what I hope to manifest in myself.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Blk Girl Soldier\"\n\"Giovanni\"\n\"Holy\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nJamila Woods, Erik Hunter, Justin Canavan, Ralph Schaefer, Aminata Burton\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Suraya Mohamed, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, CJ Riculan, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbpRu-yzNfs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbpRu-yzNfs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbpRu-yzNfs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbpRu-yzNfs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NbpRu-yzNfs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":83,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NbpRu-yzNfs"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/eyb8quwt_5tlqvx_P870xWlyG-c\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLmpLa2IycTlFYlNn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-02T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Barbara Hannigan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 26, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- In these days of wireless earbuds, streams and podcasts, the notion of people gathering to hear a lone classical singer (with a pianist) perform densely structured art songs in a foreign tongue seems almost laughably quaint.\n\nYet the vocal recital, as a performance genre, is still alive. And one of the most memorable recitals I've witnessed in a long time sits on this page, in a condensed form, thanks to the extraordinary soprano Barbara Hannigan and her accompanist Reinbert de Leeuw.\n\nThe night before this Tiny Desk concert, the two musicians gave a beautiful and intense recital at Washington's Kennedy Center. The songs, all in German, came from a heady period in Vienna, when music was transitioning from the swells of romanticism to the uncharted waters of modernism. Four of those songs make up this Tiny Desk performance. The bonus here is that these impassioned dispatches become even more intimate.\n\nConsider the opening song, Alexander Zemlinsky's \"Empfängnis\" (Conception). The harmonies are sweet, but almost too rich, like overripe fruit, when Hannigan sings lines like, \"Und wie ich sehend meine Arme breite\" (And as I open my arms with longing). You can hear the end of a musical era.\n\nAn indefatigable champion of new and modern music, Hannigan (who is also a conductor) has given the world premieres of more than 80 pieces. The voice is simply gorgeous — silvery, buttery-smooth throughout the registers, with crystalline top notes emerging from thin air and charged with emotion.\n\nIn Alma Mahler's \"Licht in der Nacht\" (Light in the Night), Hannigan taps into the mysterious sparkle of a little yellow star twinkling through black skies as de Leeuw's piano explores wayward harmonies. Hugo Wolf's \"Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt\" (Only One Who Knows Longing) is a hymn to the yearning heart. De Leeuw explains that the key of G minor, in which the song is written, never materializes. It's all about the longing for G minor.\n\nThe final song, \"Schenk mir deinen goldenen Kamm\" (the first music by Arnold Schoenberg to grace the Tiny Desk), offers a double dose of sensuality. Hannigan's beautiful middle register and creamy phrasing paint the scene: Jesus asks Mary Magdalene for her comb because it will remind him every morning that she once kissed his hair. Hannigan calls the song \"erotic\" and she delivers on that feeling when, at the end, she cries out the name \"Magdalena\" with a lustrous, silken tone, touched with anguish.\n\nHannigan told the audience that her Kennedy Center recital felt like \"a sacred moment of people coming together in very deep concentration.\" At this Tiny Desk recital, it happened all over again.\n\nSET LIST\n\nAlexander Zemlinsky: \"Empfängnis\"\nAlma Mahler: \"Licht in der Nacht\"\nHugo Wolf: \"Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt\"\nArnold Schoenberg: \"Schenk mir deinen goldenen Kamm\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nBarbara Hannigan (soprano), Reinbert de Leeuw (piano)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Tom Huizenga, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young; Page Turner: Suraya Mohamed; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jKkb2q9EbSg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jKkb2q9EbSg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jKkb2q9EbSg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jKkb2q9EbSg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jKkb2q9EbSg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":84,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jKkb2q9EbSg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/YS1LWkKYjNKkunsDR2nbS0wLqMA\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkl4QWNXN3pnQUQ0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-31T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"George Clinton & The P-Funk All Stars: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 24, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- The rhythm of family has been a constant thread throughout P-Funk's long lineage and the myriad iterations the band has undergone in its 50-plus years. From The Parliaments to Funkadelic to Parliament Funkadelic to the P-Funk All Stars, George Clinton has conducted the mothership as a reliable father figure. When he commands you to \"put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip, and come on up to the Mothership,\" he's presenting to you the first law of Funktonian physics. We at NPR pledged our groovellegiance when he and his P-Funk All Stars touched down to bless the Tiny Desk.\n\nClinton has brought his own bloodline into the most recent lineup of P-Funk: His grandchildren are the newest backup singers, while another grandchild serves as tour manager. Though this was a much smaller outfit than their traditional stage shows — no horn section, no dancers, no Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk — the extended family was also in full effect. Garrett Shider on rhythm guitar, filling in for his late father, Garry Shider, aka Starchild. Even original trumpeter Bennie Cowan, who still tours with the group but didn't make it to the Tiny Desk, typically plays alongside his son Benzel on drums. Blackbyrd McKnight and Lige Curry cement the foundation as elder statesmen who've been rocking with Clinton since 1978.\n\nIndeed, the funk father refuses to let the musicianship slip — the band was as sonically tight as ever, blessing us with a canonical three-song set list of classic jams. P-Funk's influence shaped '90s hip-hop and culture immeasurably; without Clinton, we'd have no NWA, no G-funk, no Tupac, no EPMD, no Ice Cube... and, of course, no one's forgotten about Dre. Clinton and P-Funk brought world class funksmanship, and it was our pleasure to air the room out and squeegee the floors after soaking up their cosmic slop.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Standing On The Verge Of Getting It On\"\n\n\"One Nation Under A Groove\"\n\n\"Give up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nGeorge Clinton (lead vocals), Dwayne Blackbyrd McKnight (guitar), Lige Curry (bass), Garrett Shider (guitar), Danny Bedrosian (keyboard), Benzel Cowan (drums), Tonysha Nelson (backup vocals), Patavian Lewis (backup vocals), Tairee Parks (backup vocals)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Niki Walker, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Maia Stern, Bronson Arcuri, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Christina Ascani/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IxAcW7zgAD4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IxAcW7zgAD4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IxAcW7zgAD4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IxAcW7zgAD4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IxAcW7zgAD4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":85,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"IxAcW7zgAD4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/sKz4rUEDn1JLQ739HTNvzkC6xCg\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkJmWUp0MU84WmpZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-29T14:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"St. Vincent: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 22, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Whenever I imagined a St. Vincent Tiny Desk Concert, it was always going to be loud and electric. But I didn't see this coming – the brilliant guitarist arrived at NPR with one steel string acoustic guitar and without a warm-up or soundcheck. Annie Clark stood at my desk, in front of a few hundred-plus NPR employees and close friends, and hit us hard with her un-amplified voice, unplugged guitar, her checkered wardrobe and most importantly, her songs.\n\nThese three tunes, \"New York,\" \"Los Ageless\" (not Los Angeles), and \"Slow Disco\" are all from her recent record MASSEDUCTION (not Masseducation). It's not the guitar-heavy record we're used to hearing from St. Vincent. In fact, album producer Jack Antonoff (of the bands Bleachers and Fun.) thought \"New York\" was a better piano melody than a guitar tune, so Annie had Thomas Bartlett (aka Doveman) perform it.\n\nStripped of texture and flash, the wordplay pops in these songs. The cross references between the first two bi-coastal songs are clearer. Her love of New York and her mere liking of Los Angeles and its obsession with youth and appearance are more apparent in these spare arrangements.\n\nThere's a bravery here, too, that should not go unnoticed. Behind the sunglasses and red beret is an artist who usually presents herself as part of a choreographed production. St. Vincent's current one-person shows are powered by backing tracks, lighting and lots of stage cues. It's the sort of performance that feels more about execution in my mind. This stripped-down set is more about emotion, more about a one-on-one connection, and that's the bravery. To come out from the lights and the effects, leaving the laptop sync behind, pulled me into these songs in ways both the album and her live show hadn't. I'm not faulting the record or the concert, I just found something in these songs, in this setting that had glazed past me before. I'm curious if that will happen to you.\n\nSet List\n\n\"New York\"\n\"Los Ageless\"\n\"Slow Disco\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nAnne Erin Clark\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfYJt1O8ZjY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfYJt1O8ZjY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfYJt1O8ZjY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfYJt1O8ZjY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfYJt1O8ZjY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":86,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BfYJt1O8ZjY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/5ua2pmfIqcdDjtf3z1jNq9A-374\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLmhjQUtzWFI1MUhR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-26T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Amadou and Mariam: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 19, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The title and subject of Amadou & Mariam's latest album, La Confusion, would lead you to believe that the music this married, Malian couple make might be sad and troubled. But Amadou & Mariam, on the contrary, bring some of the most lyrical melodies and joyful sounds we've ever had at the Tiny Desk, and their performance comes while their country endures great turmoil, including a coup and insurgencies.\n\nAs Amadou and Mariam said when their album was released, \"We seek to make people happy with our music, help humanitarian causes and share positive messages about the good work being done by people in every corner of the world.\"\n\nThe story of Amadou and Mariam is still worth telling almost 40-years (and eight albums) into their career because it speaks well to who they are, the obstacles they've had to overcome and the positive yet realistic attitude that has made them such an international success. Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia met when they were children in Mali's Institute for the Young Blind. Both had lost their sight when they were young and they began performing together. Later, in the 1980s, they married and began a career together.\n\nOn this occasion, they stripped down their bigger band to a keyboard, a percussionist and a backup singer while the couple holds it all together with Amadou's stuttered melodic guitar and Mariam's sweetly gruff voice. It's an inspired performance to hear and to witness.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Bofou Safou\"\n\"Dimanche à Bamako\"\n\"Filaou Bessame\"\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Tsering Bista, Bronson Arcuri; Production Assistant: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hcAKsXR51HQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hcAKsXR51HQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hcAKsXR51HQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hcAKsXR51HQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hcAKsXR51HQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":87,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"hcAKsXR51HQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/Npjm_M5DyK01AD215GwiIQ1kCU8\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkF6RFp5d1VwLW1R","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-24T14:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"The Lemon Twigs: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 17, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It's as if brothers Brian and Michael D'Addario fell from the sky, victims of a transporter beam gone awry in 1971, and landed here at my desk with guitars in hand, right next to a perfectly tuned Yamaha upright piano. When they dusted themselves off, Brian (20) and Michael (18) channeled their deep admiration for The Beatles with their own original tunes as The Lemon Twigs, playing songs from their recent EP Brothers Of Destruction, a natural extension to their debut album Do Hollywood, filled with Paul McCartney-pop leanings.\n\nAt this Tiny Desk Concert, the layers of sound found in The Lemon Twigs' recordings are stripped away, which makes the lyrics more noticeable, words that at times feel destined for a Broadway stage.\n\nIt was almost eerie seeing two young adults at my desk who look an awful lot like I and many of my friends did back around 1970. It's uncanny, almost as if Brian and Michael have been somehow shielded from the 21st century. But the truth is they look and sound like they do because they live in a world where everything is at their fingertips, where they can dive deep and explore and create a niche.\n\nIt's fair to say that the strength of The Lemon Twigs is in the songwriting and the way they layer their recordings with their multi-instrumental talents. I love what they do, not as nostalgia but for its explorations of melody, harmony and lyrics that are memorable. Even stripped down, they are a whole lot of fun.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Beautiful\"\n\"Why Didn't You Say That\"\n\"Light and Love\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nBrian D'Addario and Michael D'Addario\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzDZywUp-mQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzDZywUp-mQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzDZywUp-mQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzDZywUp-mQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzDZywUp-mQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":88,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"AzDZywUp-mQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/jX8EX4_aVQJKTEMtyMJz8D1r_Z4\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLi1UNmItb2JnbWxj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-22T14:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"The Artists From The \"Take Me to the River\" Tour: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 15, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- \n\"Take Me To The River\" is a 1974 song from the legendary Al Green and guitarist \"Teenie\" Hodges. And though it wasn't a big hit at the time, this song's mix of religion and desire has become part of pop music's canon with versions done most famously by Talking Heads, Bryan Ferry, Foghat and Levon Helm.\n\nHere at the Tiny Desk, some of the original players of this deep southern soul have come together to honor and update this tradition. It's a celebration of Memphis soul old and new, with 13 musicians wedged behind the desk.\n\nSome of those players of the old include singers Bobby Rush and William Bell; on the Hammond organ, Rev. Charles Hodges and LeRoy Hodges on bass. But it's what's new that makes this more than a look back – the addition of southern rappers Frayser Boy and Al Kapone – that truly puts this project on new musical ground.\n\nVariations of this group and subsequent tours got a jump start with a 2014 documentary film called Take Me To The River, directed by Martin Shore, which focused on the legacy of southern soul. In fact, you'll see Martin in the background playing percussion here at the Tiny Desk! It's a joyful, triumphant gathering not to be missed.

It simply rose above everything else I heard.\n\nAHI's gruff but sweet voice and openly honest words were my gateway to this young Ontario-based singer. Later that summer night in Nashville, I saw him perform an uplifting set of original, soulful tunes, ending with a cover of Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" a song AHI says he sings at the end of every set with a sense of hope. It was powerfully moving, without a note that felt clichéd or overly nostalgic. At that moment, I knew he needed to play a Tiny Desk Concert.\n\nAHI's performance here at my desk didn't disappoint. In fact, it won over a roomful of NPR employees and some friends who came by to take a chance on a new discovery. With a tasteful band comprised of Frank Carter Rische on electric guitar, Robbie Crowell on bass guitar and Shawn Killaly (a man of a million faces) on drums, AHI put his heart into three songs in just about 11 minutes, all from his debut album We Made It Through The Wreckage, which came out a year ago this week.\n\nAHI ended on the song that first attracted my attention this past summer in Nashville, the song \"Ol' Sweet Day.\" With an uplifting beat and warm sentiment, it simply feels undeniable and universal in its expression of love.\n\n\"I've got a lot to learn\nYou've got a lot to give\nWe can go anywhere\nRebuild this broken bridge\nYou've got a heart of gold\nI've got a mind that goes\nOn and on and on to places we'll never know,\nBut I just want to be with you when the day is done\nWhen the darkness comes\nWhen the ol' sweet day is done\"\n\nSet List\n\n\"Alive Again\"\n\"Closer (From a Distance)\"\n\"Ol' Sweet Day\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nAHI (vocals, guitar), Frank Carter Rische (guitar), Robbie Crowell (bass), Shawn Killaly (drums)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Bronson Arcuri, Alyse Young; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gUd7z9g8vGY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gUd7z9g8vGY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gUd7z9g8vGY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gUd7z9g8vGY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gUd7z9g8vGY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":90,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"gUd7z9g8vGY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/OO9boo0NpkZJYfSfJmJNuFHVQOA\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlcyM2dFaVV3bmUw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-19T14:00:05.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Daniil Trifonov: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 12, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- When we invited Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov to play a Tiny Desk concert, we rolled out the big guns. In place of the trusty upright, we wedged a 7-foot grand piano behind Bob Boilen's desk in preparation for the artist who The Times of London called \"without question the most astounding pianist of our age.\"\n\nThat's a pretty lofty claim, but watch and judge for yourself. His performance here is extraordinary. Still in his 20s, Trifonov seems to have it all: jaw-dropping technique and interpretive skills beyond his age. He's also a composer — the night before his NPR visit, he played his own knuckle-twisting piano concerto at the Kennedy Center here in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut for his Tiny Desk show, Trifonov focused on Chopin, beginning with the mercurial \"Fantaisie-Impromptu\" in C-sharp minor, a work that mixes sweeping melody, turbulent passion and wistful repose. Hunching close over the keyboard with feline agility, Trifonov's slender fingers glide effortlessly. He coaxes the instrument to sing tenderly in the slow central section.\n\nTrifonov follows with a pair of short tributes to Chopin by his peers. Robert Schumann's \"Chopin\" accentuates the lyrical side of Chopin, filtered through the German composer's forward-looking harmonies, while Edvard Grieg's \"Hommage à Chopin\" offers volatility, lovingly rendered.\n\nThe smartly programmed set is capped with more Chopin, but with a nod to Mozart: the finale from a set of variations based on an aria from Don Giovanni. It gives Trifonov a chance to display his lightness of touch, plus a few pianistic fireworks. Smiling, he treats the tricky filigreed runs and hand crossings as if it were a child's game. Look closely and you can see the piano shake.\n\n(Daniil Trifonov appears courtesy of Deutsche Grammophon GmbH.)\n\nSet List*\n\nChopin: \"Fantaisie-Impromptu, Op. 66\"\n\nSchumann: \"Chopin.

(It's now approaching two million views on YouTube alone.)\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2017, when I heard that a new record was imminent. I don't usually ask an artist back for a second Tiny Desk Concert simply because they have a new release — but for Julien, I had to make an exception. With all the love that surrounded her first visit to the NPR offices, I reached out to ask if she would be willing to do something different this time around. Last fall, she delivered.\n\nAll the songs for her return to the Tiny Desk come from last year's Turn Out The Lights. Just a few weeks before the album's release, she came to Washington; we tuned our piano, she brought violinist Camille Faulkner. The first two songs, \"Hurt Less\" and \"Even,\" were accompanied by Camille, with Julien on piano for the opening tune and acoustic guitar on the second. It's quite stunning, as she sings:\n\nPutting my fist through the plaster in the bathroom of a Motel 6\n\nI must have pictured it all a thousand times\n\nI swear to God I think I'm gonna die\n\nI know you were right\n\nI can't be fixed, so help me\n\nFor the last, Julien put together an arrangement of \"Appointments\" that begins on electric guitar, which then was looped as a backdrop to her on piano and voice.\n\nJulien Baker is a massively talented songwriter with a deeply caring heart and a perfectionist streak — all of which delivered to her a career-making year. We are so thrilled to have her return.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Hurt Less\"\n\n\"Even\"\n\n\"Appointments\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nJulien Baker, Camille Faulkner\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young, CJ Riculan; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZdnq5tN5vI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZdnq5tN5vI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZdnq5tN5vI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZdnq5tN5vI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZdnq5tN5vI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":92,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"XZdnq5tN5vI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/7TDcuVMHQ4H6mn1iRzf0WSlb4SI\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjZ1WEc2YlJlcVhZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-15T14:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"The Weather Station: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 8, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The Weather Station's fourth (and self-titled) album was a constant companion for me in 2017, in no small part for the song that opens the band's Tiny Desk performance.

They didn't use all of that gear, but even on this mainly acoustic, stripped-down set, Lo Moon radiated a signature sound — intimate and demonstrative, haunting yet uplifting, an old-fashioned rock beat under glimmering guitar and keys, overlaid with beautiful, textured vocals.\n\nLead singer and instrumentalist Matt Lowell says this journey began 5 1/2 years ago with \"Loveless,\" the last song in this set. He created the demo version in a basement studio in New York, moved to Los Angeles and then linked up with Crisanta Baker (guitar, bass, keyboards and backing vocals) and multi-instrumentalist and principal guitarist Sam Stewart. They spent months in a backyard shed with gear and guitars everywhere. There they learned to feed off each other, sometimes jamming on two-chord drones for six hours straight without even saying a word. With the lights turned down, it was a comfortable space for the band to catch its artistic wind and create a celestial sound.\n\nHere too at the Tiny Desk, Lo Moon is at ease, mesmerizing the audience with hooks loaded with what they call \"bunches of atmospheres\" and a gorgeous blend of soothing harmonies, pulsing rhythms and soaring melodies.\n\nSet List\n\n\"This Is It\"\n\n\"Real Love\"\n\n\"Loveless\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMatt Lowell, Samuel Stewart, Crisanta Baker, Sterling Laws\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Suraya Mohamed, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young, Bronson Arcuri; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Christina Ascani/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BVnUddPsVRk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BVnUddPsVRk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BVnUddPsVRk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BVnUddPsVRk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BVnUddPsVRk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":94,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BVnUddPsVRk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/Ju_rmqQJL_My7XIgRRxJKlHHIyk\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLml0M0RuZlRaSU0w","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-10T14:00:06.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Open Mike Eagle: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Jan. 3, 2018 | Rodney Carmichael -- Open Mike Eagle may have released one of the most political albums of 2017, but Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is also among the most personal. It comes across best in his live performances. For only the second time during his recent tour cycle, the LA-based artist played a set aided by the live instrumentation of musicians Jordan Katz (trumpet, keys, sampler), Josh Lopez (keys, sampler) and Brandon Owens (bass) for his Tiny Desk debut.\n\n\"Smells like lots of good soup in here,\" he said to the audience one-third of the way through his set. The arctic temps hadn't quite set in when he came to NPR's Washington, D.C. headquarters in December, but Open Mike still exuded plenty of warmth while performing two songs from the stellar LP he released last September.\n\nThe album made multiple NPR Music best-of-2017 lists and earned him widespread critical acclaim for its inspired look at the inhumane demolition of public housing across America. The way we talk about displacement today, you'd think it was a new phenomenon; unfortunately, our language tends to evolve faster than we do. It's been a decade since the last brick fell from the Robert Taylor Homes, the old Chicago Housing Authority project personified on the record. Yet, when it comes to excavating the politics of place, and all the racial implications inherent in cultural erasure, there is no project released in recent years that comes close.\n\nThe sound of a trumpet breathes an ominous air into his opener, \"(How Could Anybody) Feel at Home.\" But it's the underlying sense of imagination, as he sings on the hook about superpowers and secrets impossible to un-see, that gives it lift. By the time he closes out the set with \"Very Much Money,\" from his 2014 album Dark Comedy, it's apparent that Mike Eagle has come to represent those scraping to survive winter in America.\n\nSet List\n\n\"(How Could Anybody) Feel at Home\"\n\n\"Daydreaming in the Projects\"\n\n\"Very Much Money\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nOpen Mike Eagle (vocals, sampler), Jordan Katz (trumpet, keys, sampler), Josh Lopez (keys, sampler), Brandon Owens (bass)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Rodney Carmichael, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/it3DnfTZIM0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/it3DnfTZIM0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/it3DnfTZIM0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/it3DnfTZIM0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/it3DnfTZIM0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":95,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"it3DnfTZIM0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/vgakmmx1tpWGh9XUhnTPobqg-qc\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLmhwM1Q5SDA1cFY0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-02T21:19:59.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Jeff Tweedy Performs At NPR Music's 10th Anniversary Concert","description":"Despite having visited the Tiny Desk three times, and traveling to the tunnels beneath Fort Adams State Park, Jeff Tweedy has brought only a fraction of his many musical permutations to NPR Music during our first 10 years.\n\nThankfully for us and the audience at our 10th anniversary concert on Dec. 2 at the 9:30 Club, Tweedy's set managed to run the gamut of that celebrated career. From his beginnings as a slack, alt-country rocker (playing Uncle Tupelo's \"We've Been Had\") and A.M.-era Wilco (with \"Passenger Side\") to his recent turn as Mavis Staples' producer and songwriter (on \"Jesus Wept\") and later, Nels Cline-era Wilco (\"Locator\").\n\nThe constant in all this experimenting is Tweedy's voice as a singer and songwriter — one that invites a deep trust, even when it courts darkness. Performing solo with an acoustic guitar, his voice was once again at the center of it all.\n\nNaturally, Tweedy surprised, opening with an unreleased song that looks forward and back — a theme of the evening. \"I leave behind a trail of songs / from the darkest gloom to the brightest sun,\" he sang. \"I've lost my way, but it's hard to say / what I've been through should matter to you.\" It may hard to say why, but it's clear that it does. -- Ben Naddaff-Hafrey\n\nSET LIST\n\"Bombs Above\"\n\"We've Been Had\"\n\"Locator\"\n\"Jesus Wept\"\n\"Passenger Side\"\n\"I'm The Man Who Loves You\"\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Colin Marshall; Producers: Colin Marshall, Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey; Technical Director: Josh Rogosin; Live Mix Engineer: Shawn \"Gus\" Vitale; Supervising Producer: Mito Habe-Evans; Managing Producers: Bob Boilen, Jacob Ganz, Jessica Goldstein, Abby O'Neill; Creative Director and Producer: Peter Glantz; Concert Videographers: Bronson Arcuri, Kara Frame, Nickolai Hammar, Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Niki Walker; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Editor: Nickolai Hammar; Special Thanks: The 9:30 Club; Executive Producers: Anya Grundmann, Keith Jenkins.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hp3T9H05pV4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hp3T9H05pV4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hp3T9H05pV4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hp3T9H05pV4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hp3T9H05pV4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":96,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"hp3T9H05pV4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/lQqx8ZkS7NzMUSu_3sDOo-VWi7E\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnNhSElCRlBPQUxr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-24T16:46:48.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Sole of a Band 2017","description":"I see and photograph a lot of shows each year.

A pianist, bandleader and composer with a strong foothold in modern jazz, he belongs no less to the terrain of contemporary gospel, alternative hip-hop — and R&B, the category under which he won his first two Grammy awards (of three). Glasper has carved a signature out of this cross-genre dialogue; consult his recent explainer for Jazz Night in America, about the jazz roots of some famous hip-hop samples.\n\nAt NPR Music's 10th Anniversary Concert at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., Glasper came to play, bringing longtime associate Derrick Hodge on electric bass and a newer collaborator, Justin Tyson, on drums. The performance began with something like an invocation, as Hodge played a chiming and meditative elaboration on \"Portrait of Tracy,\" a ballad by Jaco Pastorius.\n\nWhat came next was an unbilled guest: Bilal, the shape-shifting R&B vocalist who has known Glasper since the first day of freshman year at the New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York. They dug into \"All Matter,\" a tune that first appeared on Glasper's 2009 album Double Booked, later resurfacing on Bilal's 2010 release Airtight Revenge. The lyrics establish a philosophical reflection well suited to our times:\n\nWe're all the same\nAnd all so very different\nDivine by design\nIt all intertwines\n\nGlasper and Bilal have performed \"All Matter\" countless times, always managing to find some new motivation in the song. This performance features a keyboard solo that starts out terse and gradually opens up and expands, hinting at some tricky rhythmic displacement that Tyson later ratifies, in his spectacular drum solo.\n\nGlasper's solemn but uplifting piano interlude leads into another Bilal original, \"Levels,\" a portrait of relationship strife that refuses to lay the blame fully on either side. It's an argument for rendering complexity with clarity — something Glasper and crew know a thing or two about. -- Nate Chinen\n\nSET LIST\n\"Portrait of Tracy\" (excerpt) by Jaco Pastorius\n\"All Matter\" by Bilal Oliver\n\"Levels\" by Bilal Oliver\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Colin Marshall; Producers: Colin Marshall, Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey; Technical Director: Josh Rogosin; Live Mix Engineer: Shawn \"Gus\" Vitale; Supervising Producer: Mito Habe-Evans; Managing Producers: Bob Boilen, Jacob Ganz, Jessica Goldstein, Abby O'Neill; Creative Director and Producer: Peter Glantz; Concert Videographers: Bronson Arcuri, Kara Frame, Nickolai Hammar, Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Niki Walker; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Editor: Annabel Edwards; Special Thanks: The 9:30 Club; Executive Producers: Anya Grundmann, Keith Jenkins.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqUWu0WNzJ8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqUWu0WNzJ8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqUWu0WNzJ8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqUWu0WNzJ8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqUWu0WNzJ8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":98,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"gqUWu0WNzJ8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k/kiDnS-va0mYCLZ3pJzpi6oLNnAU\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkZRckVtWmVDMDRV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-18T23:49:43.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Bon Iver's Justin Vernon Performs At NPR Music's 10th Anniversary","description":"Justin Vernon's career as Bon Iver has perfectly aligned with NPR Music's existence. It was 10 years ago this past summer that For Emma, Forever Ago began to write the project and the myth of its creation into indie-rock legend, making Vernon's own name nearly synonymous with it in the process. The idea of that cabin in the woods and Vernon's wounded, multi-tracked falsetto have since become iconic. That legacy has become something that Vernon and his bandmates have worked at times to escape — to beautiful effect on their latest record, the vocal processing- and sample-heavy 22, A Million (you can watch our full concert video featuring much of that album here).\n\nAt our 10th Anniversary Concert at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., Vernon performed alone, but as Bon Iver. He began with a rendition of his 2014 single \"Heavenly Father,\" the earliest prominent use of the OP-1 synthesizer which came to define 22, A Million. He concluded his set with a cover of Leon Russell's 1970 ballad, \"A Song For You.\" Vernon has an ear for covers that showcase his voice (see the jaw-dropping cover of \"Satisfied Mind\" by his early band DeYarmond Edison's or his incredibly popular \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" cover), and Russell's spare arrangement and strong melody are the perfect scaffolding for it. It is an instrument so distinctive that it brings an unmistakably singular sound to every performance, whether accompanied by acoustic guitar or OP-1, on an original song or somebody else's, no matter the project or era. -- Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey\n\nSET LIST\n\"Heavenly Father\"\n\"A Song For You\" by Leon Russell\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Colin Marshall; Producers: Colin Marshall, Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey; Technical Director: Josh Rogosin; Live Mix Engineer: Shawn \"Gus\" Vitale; Supervising Producer: Mito Habe-Evans; Managing Producers: Bob Boilen, Jacob Ganz, Jessica Goldstein, Abby O'Neill; Creative Director and Producer: Peter Glantz; Concert Videographers: Bronson Arcuri, Kara Frame, Nickolai Hammar, Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Niki Walker; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Editor: Annabel Edwards; Special Thanks: The 9:30 Club; Executive Producers: Anya Grundmann, Keith Jenkins.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FQrEmZeC04U/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FQrEmZeC04U/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FQrEmZeC04U/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FQrEmZeC04U/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FQrEmZeC04U/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":99,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FQrEmZeC04U"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/VG2SfQ15HielHRnNyLZn4lwCRLA\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLm1iZkVlM1VSdjBz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-18T23:53:32.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Margo Price Sings From A Balcony At NPR Music's 10th Anniversary Concert","description":"Margo Price sings classic country songs that manage to enchant, even as they disillusion. Her steadfast voice and songwriting conjure a powerful sense of nostalgia — she emerged in 2016 with Midwest Farmer's Daughter, an album that didn't so much callback to '70s country as it did flawlessly reanimate it. But if her musical signifiers are comfortably familiar, her lyrics stand in stark opposition to that feeling. They don't live in a soft-focus past, but are eyes-wide-open to modern America — from songs like \"Pay Gap\" to \"All American Made,\" Margo Price brings a fresh urgency to a well-worn form.\n\nStanding on the 9:30 Club balcony with a scratched old acoustic guitar, she appeared as a kind of troubadour. She paraphrased Sam Cooke — \"A voice should not be judged on whether it's beautiful or not, it should be judged on [whether it] can convince you that [it is] telling the truth.\" Price's project could easily settle for nostalgia.

Tank and the Bangas presented a whirligig of styles and sounds, drawn together by strong friendships and led by Tarriona \"Tank\" Ball's commanding performance. She asks nothing less than the full engagement of an audience — and she always gets it.\n\nEven at the end of our seven-act anniversary concert, the 9:30 Club audience met Tank and the Bangas on its level. The band played four songs — including \"Quick,\" the song that won it the Tiny Desk Contest — and Tank brought the staff of NPR Music onstage for a toast and, of course, a dance party.\n\nNPR Music is many things, but sharing the joy of musical discovery has been and always will remain our central goal.

Then, in a hair-raising arrangement by Jacob Garchik, music by the young Egyptian electro-folk artist Islam Chipsy ricocheted in frenetic waves.\n\nWritten for Kronos' open access education initiative Fifty for the Future and called \"Zaghlala,\" the piece had not been heard by any audience anywhere. The music refers to blurred vision caused by strong light hitting the eyes. Kronos' violist Hank Dutt drove the pulsating beat, swapping his viola for the Middle Eastern dumbek. Kronos also conjured up Gershwin's \"Summertime,\" inspired, Harrington noted, by Janis Joplin's mesmerizing version.\n\nFinally, at the end, came the Wilco moment.\n\nHarrington announced the last tune, \"Born Alone,\" as belonging to one of the group's favorite bands — Wilco. As the strings fired up a brand new arrangement, created for this event, Jeff Tweedy himself emerged from back stage to sing his song.\n\nIt was a stunning collaborative moment.

It was the Los Angeles rapper's first time performing at our offices, but moreover, it was the Tiny Desk's first nighttime performance, a special request from Tyler and his team in order to professionally light the \"stage\" themselves. Members of Tyler's lighting crew came to the office a day before to set it up, eventually bathing him and his band in shades of fuchsia, orange and blue — one for each song — during the early evening show.\n\nFlower Boy, Tyler's latest album, is much like this Tiny Desk performance; a surprising departure from the expected. Four albums in, he has matured as a producer, rapper and human being. Often equated to hip-hop's class clown, the 26-year-old peels back his own mask of immaturity to reveal a young adult grappling with anxiety, fear and uncertainty of self.\n\nAfter he was done, Tyler did something of a modified mic-drop, throwing his tambourine in celebration of what he and his band had accomplished. Always one to stay casually connected with his fans, Tyler made time — nearly an hour after the performance was done —- to pose for photos, sign merch and crack jokes with (and on) everyone around him.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Boredom\"\n\n\"See You Again\"\n\n\"Glitter\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTyler Okonma (vocals, keys), Jaret Landon (MD/Keys) Dré Pinckney (Bass), Dalton Hodo (Drums), Kaye Fox (background vocals), Kiandra Richardson (background vocals)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Lighting: Max McDougall; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Beck Harlan, Alyse Young; Production Assistants: Paul Wichmann, Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1w-hDiJ4dM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1w-hDiJ4dM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1w-hDiJ4dM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1w-hDiJ4dM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1w-hDiJ4dM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":103,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"N1w-hDiJ4dM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/W6BykasxIFU-r0iQqnhXTQvQd2M\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkhjQXhnRXJBa1R3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-20T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Cigarettes After Sex: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Dec. 13, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- This comes close to the quietest Tiny Desk Concert we've ever had.

The lyrics are simple and easy to remember: \"Kristen, come right back/I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed/When you light the candle.\"\n\nIn addition to minimal music, the words to these songs are stripped to their essence and it's that directness and lack of mystery I find attractive. It makes each note and each word seem to count for more than they might otherwise. And despite the light of day and the office environment of the Tiny Desk Concert, the smoky bedroom laden songs work, maybe even, in some ways, better than in a club, where just the chatter of a crowd can drown out this gentle music.\n\nSo, dim the lights, maybe light a candle and bliss out.\n\nSet List\n\n\"K.\"\n\n\"Apocalypse\"\n\n\"Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nGreg Gonzalez, Phillip Tubbs\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HcAxgErAkTw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HcAxgErAkTw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HcAxgErAkTw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HcAxgErAkTw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HcAxgErAkTw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":104,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HcAxgErAkTw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/2-8gsVffz5To1tfc5uFw136iQlI\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLmkwRi16MTMtdkhR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-21T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Hanson: NPR Music Holiday Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Dec. 18, 2017 | Stephen Thompson -- We've been recording Tiny Desk concerts for nearly a decade, and in that time, a few artists have come back for encores — folks like Wilco, Chris Thile and the inspiration for the series, Laura Gibson. One band, The Oh Hellos, came back after a year to favor us with a holiday set. But we've never, until now, asked anyone to return later the same day.\n\nBack in September, we brought in Hanson to play a set of old and new songs, in honor of a new career anthology called Middle of Everywhere. But, since Hanson has also just released a holiday album called Finally It's Christmas, Bob Boilen — our own right-jolly old elf — sprung on everyone the idea of taking an hour off between sets and bringing Ike, Taylor and Zac Hanson back for a wintery encore. Which means, as you'll see here, everything from frantic time-lapse set decoration to an intrusive snow machine.\n\nAs for the music itself, the Hanson brothers kicked off their second set of the day with a pair of rollicking originals before standing around a single mic for an a cappella mashup of \"Joy To The World\" and \"Go Tell It On The Mountain.\" All three songs are from Finally It's Christmas, which Hanson released to roughly coincide with the 20th anniversary of its million-selling holiday favorite Snowed In. So sit back, pour yourself a cup of hot cocoa — or, if you prefer, boozy egg nog — and soak up a raucous and reverent Christmas party.\n\nFrom everyone at the Tiny Desk, we hope you enjoy your holidays as much as our standing-room-only crowd enjoyed watching Zac and Taylor Hanson borrow a pair of the ugliest Christmas sweaters imaginable. (Yes, Virginia, that is a vomiting unicorn.)\n\nSET LIST\n\"Finally It's Christmas\"\n\"'Til New Years Night\"\n\"Joy To The Mountain\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nIsaac Hanson (vocals, guitar), Taylor Hanson (vocals, piano), Zac Hanson (vocals, percussion)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Stephen Thompson, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame, Nicholas Garbaty, Alyse Young; Animation: CJ Riculan; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Christina Ascani/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i0F-z13-vHQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i0F-z13-vHQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i0F-z13-vHQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i0F-z13-vHQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i0F-z13-vHQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":105,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"i0F-z13-vHQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/YTRknfnd4pPrDxQMwFL009rYlSM\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlhNYWZwX3lrbVZr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-22T14:00:05.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"This Is The Kit: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Dec. 19, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- Effortless storytelling is at the heart of This Is The Kit. And the stories the band's only permanent member, Kate Stables, weaves are profound but sweet with a tone that quietly reels you in.\n\n\"Bullet Proof\" is the opening song at the Tiny Desk – and the opening track on her fourth album, Moonshine Freeze – a song that sees the darkest challenges in life as a way to begin again. \"Everything we broke today/Needing breaking, anyway,\" Kate Stables sings as she's picking on her banjo with tides of percussion and bass flowing in. It takes two minutes before the perfectly punctuated guitar hits but completely worth the wait.\n\nThat gradual unfolding is the strength of these songs and this band. \"Moonshine Freeze,\" the last one they perform at the Tiny Desk, is the title track to the new album produced by John Parish. It's a song taken from a children's clapping game: Say \"moonshine\" three times, then freeze. But the song takes these images deeper, looking at patterns in the repetitive words, specifically patterns of three, which in Kate's mind forms a triangle or a delta and it just gets deeper.\n\nLovers of Sufjan Stevens will appreciate the gentle ways Kate Stables can touch a heart with a song. And the band she plays with here is tightly in touch with how best to support these tunes.\n\nSet List\n\"Bullet Proof\"\n\"Hotter Colder\"\n\"Moonshine Freeze\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKatherine Stables, Rosalind Leyden, Jamie Whitby-Coles, Noil Smith, Adam Schatz, Jonah Parzen-Johnson\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XMafp_ykmVk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XMafp_ykmVk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XMafp_ykmVk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XMafp_ykmVk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XMafp_ykmVk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":106,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"XMafp_ykmVk"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/GP_LcrDXGdoK8t3rTajdClwUHlU\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkpRczVYYWdmaGVJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-15T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Dec. 8, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- Put your love of perfection outside the office door and come in for some office fun. This collaboration between Philadelphia's Kurt Vile and Melbourne's Courtney Barnett is more about newfound friends poking jabs, goofing around and having fun with words than reaching any new musical heights. It's a much welcome injection of humor in the world of rock music and if you've heard their collaborative album Lotta Sea Lice, you'll find this Tiny Desk performance musically even more casual. It's akin to hearing friends play after a few afternoon beers, which is kind of what happened. (We actually had to page folks in the building hoping for some brew and were quite surprised at what the NPR staff had stashed in the fridge.)\n\nThe two singers/songwriters/guitarists have been mutual admirers and kept bumping into one another at various festivals. They find mutual love for twang and so their songs lean country, though their respective countries are hemispheres apart.\n\nKurt and Courtney tend to bring out the adolescence in one another, inspiring Kurt to pick out a song he wrote when he was roughly fourteen called \"Blue Cheese\" about, well, I'm not sure. But lines like, \"I didn't mean to cough on her/Forgot to add the fabric softener,\" just make me laugh; and in 2017, in a deeply serious political landscape, I find that quite refreshing.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Over Everything\"\n\n\"Continental Breakfast\"\n\n\"Blue Cheese\"\n\n\"Let It Go\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nCourtney Barnett, Kurt Vile\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JQs5XagfheI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JQs5XagfheI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JQs5XagfheI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JQs5XagfheI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JQs5XagfheI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":107,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"JQs5XagfheI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/-KKl-BB-OYyVOXay9gq8tJsYBHs\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkxMX2lVai1tUWZn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-13T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"King Krule: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Dec. 6, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- The Ooz, the title to King Krule's latest album, is the perfect name for his music. It conjures, in my mind, a word mashup of \"cool\" and \"jazz.\" The music is eerily evocative with lyrics that talk about the sorts of depression singer and guitarist Archy Marshall has dealt with in his young life. And, at 23, he has a lot to say on the subject. His opening song at the Tiny Desk, \"Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver),\" includes the line, \"Why'd you leave me? Because of my depression? / You used to complete me but I guess I learnt a lesson.\" The song continues with water-sinking metaphors and how he deals with the pressure. All this comes from someone who honestly looks like he couldn't care less, which seems like a far cry from the words and care he puts into his twisted, woozy tones.\n\nThose tones are played here by five other musicians, including sax, guitars, bass, drums, live vocal processing of Archy's voice and electronics. It's a winning path down a musical road rarely traveled – and an acquired taste well worth dipping in.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver)\"\n\n\"Logos/Sublunary\"\n\n\"Lonely Blue\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nArchy Marshall; Connor Atanda; John Keek; George Bass; Jack Towell; James Wilson\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Assistant Audio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Beck Harlan, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LL_iUj-mQfg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LL_iUj-mQfg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LL_iUj-mQfg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LL_iUj-mQfg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LL_iUj-mQfg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":108,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"LL_iUj-mQfg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/TEJ6qPsYYMmFMZA8B5mQZdfH190\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkJiUDFBekRmN1Qw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-11T14:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Ted Leo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Dec. 4, 2017 | Daoud Tyler-Ameen -- The Ted Leo who showed up to perform at our office this fall was no stranger to NPR Music; in fact, he'd stood on that very spot a few years earlier, trading verses with Aimee Mann in their collaborative project The Both. But he did seem like a changed man.\n\nIn the seven years since his last solo album, Leo had been steadily reevaluating his relationship with performance, the business of music and even his own voice. Over the applause that followed his opening number, the bone-rattling slow burn \"Moon Out of Phase,\" he smiled and explained the song was perhaps \"a little heavy for noon — but, practically speaking, it helps me get the cobwebs out.\"\n\nHow you listen to Leo depends on when his work came into your life. If you're a back-in-the-day type you might rep for Chisel, his '90s punk outfit born on the Notre Dame campus and bred in Washington, D.C. If you're just tuning in, you may have witnessed his understated comedy chops in arenas like The Best Show on WFMU and a highly enjoyable Twitter feed. At the center of this bell curve are those who found Leo at the dawn of the 2000s — when, at the helm of what's most commonly called Ted Leo and the Pharmacists (shout-out to the typographical variants still mucking up iTunes libraries), he kicked off a run of five stellar albums in just under 10 years, each one urgently attuned to its political context and yet defiant in its ideas of what punk could sound like and whose stories it could aim to tell. Fans will tell you the songs about eating disorders and missing old ska bands felt just as vital to their moment as those that explicitly took on Sept. 11 and the Iraq War.\n\nLeo's latest, The Hanged Man, is different: Recorded at home in fits and starts, with Leo playing most of the instruments himself, the album comprises years of reflection, his gaze fixed more often on his own life than on the headlines. But what was evident in his performance here, which included two new songs and one gem from his classic period, was an enduring knack for turning internal anxiety into kinetic energy, no matter the subject. By the time he hit the first chorus of \"Can't Go Back,\" a danceable bop about accepting that the life you have isn't quite the one you planned for, any remaining cobwebs had been scattered to the wind.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Moon Out of Phase\"\n\n\"Can't Go Back\"\n\n\"I'm A Ghost\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nTed Leo (vocals, guitar)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Daoud Tyler-Ameen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young; Editor: Bronson Arcuri; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbP1AzDf7T0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbP1AzDf7T0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbP1AzDf7T0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbP1AzDf7T0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbP1AzDf7T0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":109,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BbP1AzDf7T0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/tepY0JzK4MtggDPzvh6UfYLx1tU\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLmd3UWlIOGxtSWVV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-08T14:00:04.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Walter Martin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Dec. 1, 2017 | Robin Hilton -- Only Walter Martin would bring a barbershop quartet to the Tiny Desk. Best known as a singer and multi-instrumentalist with the band The Walkmen, Martin has spent his solo career making unabashedly joyful, sweetly innocent and playful music perfectly suited for quirky four-part harmonies. It works particularly well on the song with which he opens this performance, \"I Went Alone On A Solo Australian Tour,\" a brilliant and comical call-and-response story-song about, well, going alone on a solo Australian tour.\n\nLike much of Martin's music, the song, from his upcoming album Reminisce Bar And Grill, is wry and plain-spoken, finding humor and heart in life's smallest moments. But unlike his previous batch of mostly children's songs (on 2014's We're All Young Together and this year's My Kinda Music), \"I Went Alone On A Solo Australian Tour\" is really a weightier meditation on where Martin finds himself in life, now, as a married middle-aged father. He follows it in this set with the equally charming if slightly more wistful \"Me And McAlevey,\" a reflection on his close friendship with a songwriter from Maine and the power of music to give meaning and perspective to life.\n\nMartin closes with \"Sing To Me,\" his best-known song, thanks in no small part to its appearance in an Apple ad. While the original version includes a conversation sung back and forth with Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O, Martin here takes on both parts and slows the tempo down just enough to find the loneliness at the heart of what is otherwise an earnest love song.\n\nThe barbershop quartet Martin brought along for this Tiny Desk performance is known as The Glen Echoes, a group of singers he found online and met for rehearsals the day before coming to NPR.\n\nReminisce Bar And Grill is due out early next year on Flottante Music.\n\nSet List\n\n\"I Went Alone On A Solo Australian Tour\"\n\n\"Me And McAlevey\"\n\n\"Sing To Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nWalter Martin; Josh Kaufman; Jamie Krents; Brian Kantor; Richard Cook; Ken Sleeman; Mike Holmes; Al Blount\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Niki Walker, Alyse Young, Nicholas Garbaty; Assistant Editor: Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwQiH8lmIeU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwQiH8lmIeU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwQiH8lmIeU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwQiH8lmIeU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwQiH8lmIeU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":110,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"gwQiH8lmIeU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/rqIEdybEo6g75Y3KbW8rpct83K0\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkM0LTBROFc4TmIw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-06T14:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Moses Sumney: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Nov. 29, 2017 | Bob Boilen --Moses Sumney puts a great deal of thought into the heartfelt music he creates. On his debut album, Aromanticism, he was inspired by everything from the works of Plato and Aristophanes' account of the origin of humanity to the Bible, particularly Genesis and the story of creation. It's all in an attempt to understand human relationships and the sorts of couplings we tend to be drawn to. But despite the working and reworking it took to put these ideas to song, and to then make his brilliant debut, there's a spontaneous side that you'll see in this Tiny Desk Concert.\n\nThe concert opens up with Moses not behind my desk, but at the piano we keep in our office. As his team of sax, harp and guitar players set up, Moses sat at the piano and began to play \"Doomed.\" He had instructed the band, which had already perched behind my desk 40 or so feet away, to create a transition for him to walk from piano to desk, continuing one of the most inspired 8-minute stretches I've witnessed here at the Tiny Desk. And there was more to come.\n\nIf you don't know this Los-Angeles-based force of nature, and haven't heard him on tour with James Blake or Sufjan Stevens or perhaps on albums by Beck or Solange, then this is your chance to watch one of the most thoughtful talents of today as he makes music that is outside the box but easy to relate and connect to.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Doomed\"\n\n\"Quarrel\"\n\n\"Plastic\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nMoses Sumney (vocals/guitar/keys/loops), Sam Gendel (sax/guitar), Mike Haldeman (guitar), Brandee Younger (harp)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, Josephine Nyounai, Karla Barrera; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young, CJ Riculan; Production Assistants: Salvatore Maicki, Stephen Thompson; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4-0Q8W8Nb0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4-0Q8W8Nb0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4-0Q8W8Nb0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4-0Q8W8Nb0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4-0Q8W8Nb0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":111,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"C4-0Q8W8Nb0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Fjnd-bB5OCMVZkisXVZc6rEb5-I\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLi1oTEpOWlNJd1A4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-04T14:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Phoebe Bridgers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Nov. 27, 2017 | Stephen Thompson --Phoebe Bridgers' songs come laden with sly, finely detailed observations about unsuccessful flirtations with hypnotherapy, unsettling conversations about Jeffrey Dahmer, and everything in between.

Classically trained, Ledisi is also celebrated as a jazz artist, which she clearly demonstrated when she broke out into a effortless scat outro on her second song, \"I Blame You.\"\n\nWith nine Grammy nominations and an impressive discography, it's easy to be awed by her musical accomplishments. But in person, what's just as impressive as her exquisite artistry is her radiant spirit of contentment and grace. You can see it when Terrell, her makeup artist, goes behind the desk between songs to powder her face. (It was an exceptionally hot day.) Ledisi responded to the interruptions not like a diva, but with humor, humility and gratitude.\n\nThe lyrics to the third song, \"Add To Me,\" speak to having self-confidence and ensuring self-care in any relationship: \"I've been in a spiritual space / So when it's getting hard, don't break / Show me you're a winner, I don't need a quitter / How you gon' add to me?\" Ledisi finishes the set with a tribute to Prince and even more positive messaging. \"High\" is about being high on life — a reminder that no matter what chaos and circumstances exist, we should all find one good thing to love every day.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Let Love Rule\"\n\"I Blame You\"\n\"Add To Me\"\n\"High\"\n\nMusicians\n\nLedisi (vocals); Sara Williams (vocals); Kerry Marshall (guitar); James Agnew (percussion)\n\nCredits\n\nProducers: Suraya Mohamed, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Beck Harlan, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/23kmzrsjmCU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/23kmzrsjmCU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/23kmzrsjmCU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/23kmzrsjmCU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/23kmzrsjmCU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":113,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"23kmzrsjmCU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/v3Q11qMMZtCQHc2PltXW9MZ1wR0\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkplUlhDalpRQUhN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-01T14:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"David Greilsammer: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Nov. 27, 2017 | Tom Huizenga -- Like a good mixtape from a friend, performances by David Greilsammer tend to range widely in repertoire and surprise with cunning juxtapositions. On a recent album for example, the Israeli pianist alternated sonatas by avant-garde pioneer John Cage and baroque master Domenico Scarlatti.\n\nFor this Tiny Desk appearance, Greilsammer assembles similarly strange bedfellows. He begins with his muse Scarlatti, the 18th-century Italian whose 500-some keyboard sonatas are compelling, colorful snapshots of his decades-long service to Spanish royalty. In the Sonata in E, you can hear a little street band processing along with trumpet fanfares. Greilsammer follows by jumping ahead 175 years to the eccentric Frenchman Erik Satie, who not only owned seven identical gray velvet suits but, with a freewheeling spaciousness and humor in his music, is often thought of as the precursor to everything from minimalism to new age. His series of mysterious pieces called Gnossiennes strike a particularly sedate mood, capable of neutralizing any source of anxiety.\n\nLastly, Greilsammer takes a left turn to Leoš Janáček, the idiosyncratic Czech composer from the early 20th century, acclaimed for his operas. He set one of them on the moon; another, the dramatically taut and emotionally wrenching Jenůfa, is perhaps the most undervalued opera of a generation. But Janáček also wrote in smaller forms. His piano cycle On An Overgrown Path plays out like a diary of musings, nervous tics, simple pleasures and mysteries. Within the claustrophobic tension that pervades \"The Barn Owl Has Not Flown Away,\" you can hear the rustling of wings and the repeated four-note bird call.\n\nFor Greilsammer, who recently performed in a working crypt in Harlem, threading these disparate musical fabrics together comes as naturally as, well, playing behind a desk in an office building.\n\nSet List\n\nDomenico Scarlatti: \"Sonata in E, K. 380\"\n\nErik Satie: \"Gnossienne No. 3\"\n\nLeoš Janáček: \"The Barn Owl Has Not Flown Away\" (from On An Overgrown Path)\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nDavid Greilsammer (piano)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Tom Huizinga, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JeRXCjZQAHM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JeRXCjZQAHM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JeRXCjZQAHM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JeRXCjZQAHM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JeRXCjZQAHM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":114,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"JeRXCjZQAHM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ImTXzIM9ZeL_bw4q63ntk26CCtA\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnUxZ3lwY3JQWEpR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-17T23:07:14.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Miguel On The Creative Process & Writing 'Adorn' In Three Hours | Noteworthy","description":"Over three increasingly innovative albums, Miguel has offered a 21st-century update on classic psychedelic soul music. Following in the footsteps of pioneers like Marvin Gaye and Sly & the Family Stone, the Los Angeles native — he was raised in the beachfront community of San Pedro — has drawn from funk, rock, punk, dub and the full range of bedroom-focused R&B while ruminating on subjects like love, sex, intimacy, identity and politics. Along the way, he has collaborated with Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar and Mariah Carey, among many others, and in 2012, he won a Grammy for Best R&B song for \"Adorn.\" Now, in the first installment of the new NPR Music documentary series Noteworthy, the singer reveals the secrets behind his creative process.\n\nThis summer, Noteworthy host Jason King visited Miguel in his Los Angeles home and spoke with him in the studio where he's working on songs for an upcoming fourth album. Miguel tells King that until recently, his creative process relied on consuming as much as possible — \"ideas, films, art, relationships\" — in order to get to a place where inspiration could flow freely. \"'Adorn' happened in a night,\" he tells King of his signature hit. \"I literally like landed at 10:30 or 11:00, couldn't sleep and just wrote the song.\" Within \"two-and-a-half, three hours,\" he had written and recorded the whole song. Now, Miguel finds himself at a moment where thinking about social movements like Black Lives Matter is pushing him toward a mode of songwriting driven by a new feeling of responsibility. He also reveals how he began writing songs on his father's guitar, his love for Bill Withers, why Salvador Dali is on his wallpaper, the best advice Pharrell ever gave him and the importance of L.A. to his artistic vision.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u1gypcrPXJQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u1gypcrPXJQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u1gypcrPXJQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":115,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"u1gypcrPXJQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/NMl0i1b_OH838zV8D6x-o0slp4o\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLm9hU05fYkhqeUl3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-27T14:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Billy Corgan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Nov. 20, 2017 | Robin Hilton -- Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan is a complicated guy. In the years since that iconic and much-beloved rock band broke up in 2000, Corgan has continued to put out music under various names and projects – including several releases as Smashing Pumpkins, with different lineups – while often stumbling through a bumpy minefield of his own making. To the head-scratching surprise of some longtime fans, he's gotten heavily involved in pro wrestling, talked conspiracy theories during several appearances on The Alex Jones Show (warning of weaponized zombies in one interview), and, over the years, lobbed innumerable grievances about former bandmates, while trashing other musicians and publicly feuding with a revolving cast of celebrities and public figures.\n\nMore recently, Corgan seems to have mellowed. He opted to release his new solo album Ogilala, under his (very grownup-sounding) full name, William Patrick Corgan (though he very recently changed it back to Billy Corgan on streaming services and YouTube), and filled the record with beautifully rendered acoustic songs built on piano and strings.\n\nWhen he settled in for this memorable Tiny Desk performance with a string quartet he'd just met hours before, Corgan was nothing but a good-natured delight. After years of selling millions of records and playing packed arenas, he showed up in a cab with just his tour manager and, during setup and rehearsals, joked about being all DIY now.\n\nDressed for winter weather in a heavy scarf, hoodie, down jacket and cap, Corgan opened with a stirring rendition of the 1995 Smashing Pumpkins song \"Tonight, Tonight.\" It was a transporting moment that left some fans in the NPR offices a little misty eyed. Corgan then followed with two Ogilala standouts, \"Aeornaut\" and \"Mandarynne,\" songs about staying strong and true to yourself and soldiering on in the face of a troubled world.\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins always had a soft side, from the more melancholy moments of 1991's \"Rhinoceros\" to \"Sweet Sweet,\" \"Take Me Down\" and Adore's gorgeous opener, \"To Shelia.\" But here the beauty and grace of Corgan's poetry and songwriting is on full display.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Tonight, Tonight\"\n\n\"Aeronaut\"\n\n\"Mandarynne\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nBilly Corgan (vocals, guitar, piano), Kristin Bakkegard (violin), Livy Amoruso (violin), Paul Bagley (viola), Carol Anne Bosco (cello)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Nicholas Garbaty, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oaSN_bHjyIw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oaSN_bHjyIw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oaSN_bHjyIw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oaSN_bHjyIw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oaSN_bHjyIw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":116,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oaSN_bHjyIw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Pf1qcg92SoL5yBG4W_PN29CY9S4\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkk0OGNhbW5zN0tZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-24T14:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Benjamin Booker: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Nov. 17, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- \nBenjamin Booker has a deeply tender voice that, at times, can feel like a whisper But it always cuts to the heart. \"Believe,\" his opening number at the Tiny Desk has a yearning for something to hold on to, something to understand. It's a timeless desire which can be about the personal or the political. But on the second song, \"Witness,\" the title track to his 2017 album, the 28-year-old New Orleans-based singer bears witness to both the racism he's experienced and the hatred still prevalent in our culture and reflected in the daily news.\n\nThe title cut is sung here with Saundra Williams (you may recognize her singing alongside the late Sharon Jones on a previous Tiny Desk Concert). The song reflects on two main questions: Will we be a witness to the wrong in the world and is that enough?\n\nIt's a potent message that questions the meaning of Booker's own life, but also asks listeners to question the meaning of theirs.

Its songs carried in them a weary recognition of how desire and nostalgia linger in the body and mind, and zoomed in on the brittle filaments that bind together people who have long since declared themselves better off apart. \"I can sleep, I can sleep, I can sleep — soon,\" went one characteristically fraught line, teasing relief and then snatching it away as guitars cracked and rumbled like fireworks.\n\nThere's not much material evidence of how the band's next move might be different, but what little we have to go on is striking. Now, Now took the Tiny Desk stage with a minimal setup (dig the sampler as drum kit) that laid the vocals bare, but still lent the songs a room-filling pulse. Among those songs were \"SGL\" and \"Yours,\" the two singles that heralded the band's return this summer (a full five years after Threads, with a pared-down lineup and no album yet announced, though the rumors say next year). As their performance here makes clear, KC Dalager and Bradley Hale have added a few new tools to their arsenal — synth-forward arrangements, that triplet swagger you loved from \"The Wire\" and \"Run Away With Me,\" the word \"baby\" — but their focus on tiny moments between people just outside of love is as sharp as ever.

But that hasn't kept him from becoming the hip-hop artist with the hardest-to-pronounce name of the moment. He's been called everything from anime (as in Japanese animation) to amino (as in the acid). But after watching the Portland native perform three songs from his Good For You debut album, with a four-piece band and background singer crammed behind Bob Boilen's Tiny Desk, Aminé (pronounced ah-MEE-nay) should be hard to forget.\n\nHis debut single \"Caroline\" is definitely recognizable after peaking at No. 11 on Billboard's Hot 100 last year. Aminé followed it up one year later with an LP that expanded on his colorful pop chops with R&B-styled grooves and a mannish flow that's given his hometown more mainstream hip-hop cred than it's enjoyed since Fred Armisen fumbled through the history of rap on an old episode of Portlandia.\n\nDespite openly criticizing Donald Trump during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the closest that Aminé — a son of Ethiopian immigrants — came to making a political statement here was a funny aside about the imposing gate in front of the White House. Instead, he made his music the focus, while taking occasional sips from a big red cup of tea.\n\nAs for the bananas that have become Aminé's well-known trademark, several NPR interns gifted him with a bunch right after his set.

We lost David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Prince (and so many more beloved artists). And then there were the elections and subsequent inauguration, which were devastating to many. But what transpired next for anyone dismayed by those events was inspiring: The Women's March united many who were in despair, while giving purpose and focus to what for them was an unthinkable outcome in the election of Donald Trump.\n\nThen came the songs – nine new ones Laura wrote with Patrick Damphier, inspired by the many marches around the country, listening to the news, seeing social media, talking to friends and taking it all in. The result is The Mynabirds' politically charged 2017 album Be Here Now.\n\nI first met Laura Burhenn ten years ago for a songwriting project she did with John Davis, her then bandmate in the duo Georgie James, here at NPR called Project Song. I was thrilled to discover her talent. Her current band, The Mynabirds, are Tiny Desk alum, Laura having played her first Tiny Desk Concert in the spring of 2010.\n\nI'm not one to repeat artists at the Tiny Desk. I'm more into discovering and challenging new bands to play in this intimate and awkward setting. But this project was so different and Laura had ideas about how to make it even more special from what she'd done back in 2010, so I couldn't resist.\n\nWhile recording this album, a travel ban was issued affecting six Muslim-majority countries. She wrote a song for refugees inspired by the ban and got in touch with friends back in Omaha at the Refugee Empowerment Center. It is there she learned of the Umoja Choir whose members include resettled refugees from The Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia and they ended up singing on her record. Laura also started a GoFundMe campaign for them to record their songs. Now some of those choir members have come to the Tiny Desk for a powerful set of songs.

But she's also kept her core values intact, from her outspoken commitment to progressive social causes to her strenuously maintained independence from the machinery of the music industry.\n\nFor her Tiny Desk debut, DiFranco brought a hell of a backing band, with drummer Terence Higgins and singer/violinist Jenny Scheinman joined by none other than Ivan Neville on keyboards. Together, they lend a slithery underpinning of funk to three songs that stretch across much of DiFranco's career. After opening with \"Dithering,\" from 2014's Allergic To Water, DiFranco introduces \"Play God\" (from this year's Binary) with a monologue about reproductive rights and gender relations; later, she and her band close with 1998's \"Swan Dive,\" which she calls \"an early attempt at a happy song.\"\n\nFor DiFranco, now 20 albums into a fruitful career, happy songs come easier than they used to; like anyone who's done anything steadily for 28 years, she's in a different place than she used to be. But on a fundamental level, she's the same tough and uncompromising singer-songwriter she's always been.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Dithering\"\n\"Play God\"\n\"Swan Dive\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nAni DiFranco (vocals, guitar); Jenny Scheinman (violin, vocals); Ivan Neville (keyboards); Terence Higgins (drums)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T7xWl50pKyo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T7xWl50pKyo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T7xWl50pKyo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T7xWl50pKyo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T7xWl50pKyo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":121,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"T7xWl50pKyo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/YKjRtXKeeaRreJzGVJIEdEnrJlQ\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnBlWWNObTNKVGU4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-10T14:00:09.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Nate Smith + KINFOLK: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Nov. 3, 2017 | Suraya Mohamed -- Rhythm is the foundation for many a musical experience.

It was only after The Fugees had the world in their collective palms, and then disbanded, when we got to know his unadulterated abilities as a musician — his first solo album The Carnival was a project equal to (if not greater than) his greatest successes with The Fugees. From there, his focus shifted to discovering and producing stars, stretching all genres in his solo mission, and philanthropic work for his homeland of Haiti.\n\nA seasoned pro, he walked through our doors greeting and charming anyone within arm's reach. Once in front of an audience, he was in attack mode, playing every instrument in sight. Clef doled out stories ranging from his upbringing and rise with The Fugees to intimate musical encounters with Whitney Houston and Destiny's Child. The mentions were properly placed and added substance to the performance, but to me, he pulled what I'd call a \"subtle stunt.\" Hip-hop is and has always been about youth and freshness, so most elder statesmen of rap aren't celebrated to the degree of their peers in rock 'n' roll and country music. Every now and again it's necessary to inform the younger generation, who would otherwise never know these epic moments ever happened.\n\nOver the past few years, we've seen a resurgence of sorts for Wyclef. Young Thug noted a heavy influence, naming a song after him and then tag-teaming on a different track on last year's Jeffery; one of the biggest songs of 2017, DJ Khaled's \"Wild Thoughts,\" prominently samples Wyclef's colossal collaboration with Carlos Santana on \"Maria Maria.\" His career trajectory was recently documented on TV One's Unsung, and in September he dropped the third installment of The Carnival. He starts his set with two highlights from his latest record, and finishes with a climactic rendition of his signature hit like you've never seen or heard.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Borrowed Time\"\n\"Turn Me Good\"\n\"Gone Till November\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nWyclef Jean (guitar, bass, keyboards and vocals); Jazzy Amra (vocals); Patrick Andriantsialonina (bass); Manny Laine (drums)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Alyse Young, Nicholas Garbaty; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Christina Ascani/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhnLJwmEy_k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhnLJwmEy_k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhnLJwmEy_k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhnLJwmEy_k/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhnLJwmEy_k/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":123,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"EhnLJwmEy_k"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/_DX8N7MAa6TxHBmrUxjP1tE4GIs\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnNOQWlsNlZsY2hF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-08T14:00:04.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Gracie and Rachel: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Nov. 1, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- On first hearing the Gracie And Rachel song \"Only a Child,\" I was struck by the tension and the mystery, both musically and lyrically: \"I'm moving my mouth but I don't say a word/My ears are open but nothing is heard/I'm only a child, only a child.\"\n\nGracie Coates, the primary singer and keyboard player, wrote and told me, \"It was this notion of going in circles, trying to move forward but constantly feeling like I was right back where I'd started.\" Along with Rachel Ruggles on a violin processed through various pedals, the two Berkeley California high school friends – now New York loft-mates – have made one of my favorite albums of 2017.

Bilal: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Oct. 30, 2017 | Abby O'Neill -- Can you believe it? Yes, those are The Roots packed behind the Tiny Desk. Black Thought, Questlove and the crew carved out a few hours in their hectic Tonight Show schedule to visit NPR headquarters in Washington D.C. Why travel four hours for a 12-minute concert when you own the late-night airwaves? The answer can be found in the lyrics to The Roots' new song, \"It Ain't Fair.\"\n\nArmed with the incredible vocalist Bilal, The Roots performed the signature track from Detroit, a film about the race riots in 1967. \"It Ain't Fair\" glares unflinchingly, takes a knee and raises a fist against the societal construct that has systematically denied equality of experience to those \"presumed inferior,\" to quote one of Bilal's verses. And it achieves all this while covering its heart with its right hand. This reflective hymn tenderly yanks your heart strings and offers a window into the ethos of those who would like to stand for the flag but cannot in good principle, lest these same evils continue to exist.\n\nThose lucky enough to be in the Tiny Desk audience witnessed masters at work. Black Thought is truly one of the most intelligent emcees ever, and his razor-sharp lyricism was on full display. Questlove, a musical and cultural historian nonpareil, was both a metronomical and moral anchor. It felt like the culmination of decades of academic rigor and boom-bap sessions, fittingly backed by a seven-piece horn section. Bilal's falsetto-laced vocals and warm resonance evoked powerful messaging reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield's \"Don't Worry,\" delivered with the eccentricity of Prince.\n\nLate last year, Common premiered \"Letter to the Free\" at the Tiny Desk and later won an Emmy for the song. It wouldn't surprise me if \"It Ain't Fair\" becomes another award-winning performance when the Oscars roll around early next year. This is a song that deserves to be heard in the millions of households that watch The Roots every night.\n\nSet List\n\n\"It Ain't Fair\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nCurtis L.

When she finally returned home, she immediately called some friends for the kind of party that is ubiquitous in Latin America: lots of social drinking, lots of food and lots of guitars and singing. Classic folk songs were on the playlist and a good time was had by all.\n\nSomeone recorded the informal jam session and Lafourcade's management team heard the tapes. \"This is your next record!\" they told her.\n\nThat record, Musas: Un Homenaje al Folclore Latinoamericano en Manos de los Macorinos, Vol. 1, was a commercial and critical hit, and received a Latin Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. It only made sense for Lafourcade to bring her Musas tour to the Tiny Desk.

After releasing its debut album, Psychopomp last year, the band returned with this year's stunning Soft Sounds From Another Planet. Where Psychopomp, written in the immediate aftermath of the death of Zauner's mother, zeroed in on the experience of Zauner's grief, Soft Sounds widens her aperture, featuring paeans to her coping mechanisms, ruminations on crooked relationship dynamics and said sci-fi robot fantasy.\n\nAt its Tiny Desk concert, the band swapped out Soft Sound's gauzy, astral synths for acoustic guitar and piano, and was joined by members of Washington, D.C. string quartet Rogue Collective. Zauner had wanted to do something special for the performance, and was tipped off by Landlady's Adam Schatz that the Rogue Collective make pretty great Tiny Desk partners. The Collective practiced with Japanese Breakfast the day before the Tiny Desk, and was a featured guest later that night at the band's D.C. show.\n\nThe adaptation highlighted Zauner's strength as a songwriter, providing an even more direct line into the raw emotion at the heart of her songs. The string swells during \"Boyish\" lent gravity to the song's bittersweet desperation. During \"Till Death,\" her ode to marriage, Zauner sang — as she often does — in a way that strains her voice to the crackling, taut edge of heartbreak. It's arresting on any stage, but particularly powerful in the stark midday light of NPR Music's office.\n\nFor its final song at the Tiny Desk, Japanese Breakfast performed \"This House.\" Gone was the Rogue Collective, and indeed much of the band — just Zauner and pianist Craig Hendrix remained. The song describes moments in love that are more fearful labor than bliss, the hazy space where commitment, confusion and longing intersect. Like much of Japanese Breakfast's music, the performance shows Zauner looking unblinkingly at fear and pain, daring us to do the same.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Boyish\"\n\"Till Death\"\n\"This House\"\nMUSICIANS\n\nMichelle Zauner; Deven Craige, Craig Hendrix; Peter Bradley; Alexa Cantalupo; Kaitlin Moreno; Natalie Spehar\n\nCREDITS\n\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen; Producers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Niki Walker, Bronson Arcuri, Colin Marshall; Photo: Christina Ascani/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tK4gaJwXw_4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tK4gaJwXw_4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tK4gaJwXw_4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tK4gaJwXw_4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tK4gaJwXw_4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":127,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"tK4gaJwXw_4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/prmjVuvnTbW9UW25XxnYND-Nqkg\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjR3UVV2ODdVUllV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-30T13:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Shabazz Palaces: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Oct. 23, 2017 | Rodney Carmichael -- \"...

It's impossible not to envision the Seattle studio, Black Space Labs, where Shabazz's otherworldly soundscapes emerge to provide the ideal backdrop for shining a light on the fake.\n\nFrom the beginning, with 2011's Black Up, Shabazz's practice has been steeped in black magic of a different order. The same proves true on its latest two releases, the conceptual Quazarz vs. The Jealous Machines and Quazarz: Born On A Gangster Star. Leave it to hip-hop's unorthodox lot to conceive an ambitious pairing that launches the narrative's protagonist on an interstellar journey far from home. It's the perfect proxy for the growing sense of alienation we're all suffering, to some degree or another, in today's space and time.\n\nWhile the premise of Tiny Desk usually involves artists stripping down their set, Shabazz Palaces' entire steelo is about unplugging from the metaphorical matrix, and sometimes a hybrid of digital-analog plugins is exactly what it takes to navigate alternate dimensions.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Colluding Oligarchs\"\n\"They Come In Gold\"\n\"Shine A Light\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nIshmael Butler, Tendai Maraire, Otis Calvin\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Suraya, James Willetts, Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Niki Walker, Bronson Arcuri; Production Assistant: Kara Frame.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4wQUv87URYU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4wQUv87URYU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4wQUv87URYU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4wQUv87URYU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4wQUv87URYU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":128,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4wQUv87URYU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/9OC51K2BwK1CIN5tJg9gFn27a-0\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkdrVVktYVZ1TlFv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-27T13:00:05.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"The Perceptionists: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Oct. 20, 2017 | Abby O'Neil -- Mr. Lif and Akrobatik are two emcees whose names rock bells among true hip-hop heads.

While Lif has been touring and writing with downtempo icons Thievery Corporation for the greater part of the last seven years, Akrobatik's last solo album (2014's Built To Last) rightfully received a warm reception from critics and connoisseurs.\n\nTheir conscious ethos is perfectly encapsulated by Ak's lyrical run on \"A Different Light,\" where he raps: \"But I'm above all of the melodrama / When they go low / We go high / Michelle Obama.\" The song tells the story of Ak's near-death experience with a pernicious aortic dissection, as well as the betrayal of a close friend during his convalescence. Akrobatik took the high road, and that ironclad stoicism lights the path for this crew. On the same track, Lif laments love lost while rhyming his way to healing catharsis following an unmanageable heartbreak.\n\nWith sharp, heartfelt lyricism, The Perceptionists critique the current political climate on \"Out Of Control\" and rhyme about the symbiotic human relationship with technology on \"Lemme Find Out.\" In a world that often appears to be spiraling out of control, their Tiny Desk set provides a much-needed breather.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Out of Control\"\n\"Lemme Find Out\"\n\"A Different Light\"\n\"Early Morning\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nTommy Benedetti (drums); Van Gordon Martin (guitar); Lean Thomas (keyboard); Ashish Vyas (bass); Jeffery Haynes (vocals); Jared Bridgeman (vocals)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Abby O'Neill , Bronson Arcuri; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Bronson Arcuri, Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Maia Stern; Production Assistant: Aleli May Vuelta; Photo: Christina Ascani/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GkUY-aVuNQo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GkUY-aVuNQo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GkUY-aVuNQo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GkUY-aVuNQo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GkUY-aVuNQo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":129,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"GkUY-aVuNQo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/gQSlFlKATE8sde-_MaCKsTO3khM\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnpoVmdiWmRNZGIw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-25T13:00:06.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Thundercat: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Oct. 18, 2017 | Bobby Carter -- Thundercat, born Stephen Bruner, is willing and able to shape-shift to fit into just about any box you show him — he just won't stay in there for long. Whether fusing his talent for jazz while a bassist with punk legacy act Suicidal Tendencies or as a member of Snoop Dogg's band — maybe running a little too far with a solo here and there — the focus seems to eventually drift his way.\n\nAfter releasing two brilliant solo albums, he was plucked to work on what eventually became one of the most important works of art released this decade: Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly. Capitalizing off of the new exposure, he quickly released the EP The Beyond/Where the Giants Roam. That was followed about two years later by Drunk, his most solid project to date.\n\nI didn't know what to expect in the days leading to the performance, but I was hoping to get what I thought a Thundercat experience would be like. All boxes ended up checked: He arrived wearing a neon pink hoodie with his signature logo plastered about, kickboxing shorts, white chancletas, playing a Nintendo portable gaming console. He and his bandmates Dennis Hamm, Justin Brown and Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, all master musicians in their own right, polished off some bacon croissant sandwiches and proceeded to give us three of the best of what Drunk has to offer.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Lava Lamp\"\n\"Friend Zone\"\n\"Them Changes\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nSteven Bruner (vocals, bass); Dennis Hamm (keys); Justin Brown (drums); Miguel Antwood Ferguson (violin)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Alyse young; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zhVgbZdMdb0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zhVgbZdMdb0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zhVgbZdMdb0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zhVgbZdMdb0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zhVgbZdMdb0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":130,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"zhVgbZdMdb0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/_XVpuuzkzdGV5fgXExA2NEP7h5E\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnJiNHRYcVBJN05V","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-23T10:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Hanson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Oct. 16, 2017 | Stephen Thompson -- The audience for Hanson's first Tiny Desk concert could be cleanly sorted into two distinct camps: the curious and the committed. The curious were the ones who'd inquired about whether the band would play its 1997 smash \"MMMBop\" (answer: nope), or wondered what Isaac, Taylor and Zac Hanson have been up to since the '90s (answer: touring constantly, putting out records, starting their own label, raising families, launching a music festival, developing a line of Hanson Brothers-branded \"MMMHops\" beer). As for the committed? They were psyched.\n\nFor those who haven't kept up, Hanson has maintained a lovingly ravenous fan base. The night before this performance, the brothers played to a joyous sold-out crowd at Silver Spring, Maryland's 2,000-capacity Fillmore — and, it turns out, some of those 2,000 folks work at NPR. (A few even had friends fly in for the occasion.) We tried to get the committed as close to the Tiny Desk action as possible, because the vibe in the room was special.\n\nThis year marks Hanson's 25th anniversary as a band, and it's been 20 years since the release of Middle of Nowhere, the album that made stars out of the Hansons when Isaac was 16, Taylor was 14 and Zachary was 11. With a greatest-hits collection just out — it's called Middle of Everywhere — this was a perfect time to catch up on a few post-\"MMMBop\" career highlights. That meant opening with \"Thinking 'Bout Somethin'\" (from 2010's Shout It Out) and ducking back to 2000 for the title track from This Time Around before closing with Hanson's charmingly infectious new single, \"I Was Born.\"\n\nOh, and as the tagline at the end of the video cryptically notes: \"To be continued...\" We'll just leave it at that.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Thinking 'Bout Somethin'\"\n\"This Time Around\"\n\"I Was Born\"\n\nMusicians\n\nIsaac Hanson (guitar, vocals); Taylor Hanson (piano, vocals); Zac Hanson (percussion, vocals)\n\nCredits\n\nProducers: Stephen Thompson, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame, Alyse Young, Nicholas Garbaty; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Jennifer Kerrigan/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rb4tXqPI7NU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rb4tXqPI7NU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rb4tXqPI7NU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rb4tXqPI7NU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rb4tXqPI7NU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":131,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rb4tXqPI7NU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/6giyoG4N4iA64hLUOOLZsVeRAWo\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLkFiOFlubUhCNnRF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-19T14:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Marlon Williams: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Feb. 12, 2018 | Bob Boilen --Marlon Williams is a handsome devil with a heart-stopping voice, who writes songs about vampires and horror films. This 27-year old, New Zealand-born, Melbourne-based singer is also a teller of tales.\n\nMarlon Williams is in love with a good, traditional blues or country tune and that's just how he opens this Tiny Desk Concert, with a song called \"When I Was A Young Girl\" (also known traditionally as \"One Morning In May\" or \"The Bad Girl's Lament\"). The best-known version of it was probably by Nina Simone until Feist tackled the tune. But Marlon Williams' rendition is more stunning than any version I've heard and seems to conjure the spirit of Roy Orbison with its long, deep-throated incantations. The purity of Marlon Williams' voice is rare and entrancing.\n\nAfter that first tune, performed solo with just his acoustic guitar, he strapped on his electric guitar, brought out his band, snapped his fingers to set the beat and sang about being stoned and running around Los Angeles dressed as a vampire. At the time of our taping, back in October of last year, \"Vampire Again\" was the newest song since Marlon Williams' 2016, self-titled release.\n\nAfter finishing that tune and losing his guitar pick, he found one left behind by Wilco and launched into a tune we'd not heard before. He calls \"What's Chasing You\" a song about horror films, but it sounds like a 1950s tune about unrequited love.\n\nThe brilliant session ends as the band gathered around a single microphone for another new tune called \"Make Way For Love.\" We now know it's the title track to Marlon Williams' forthcoming album and it reveals an intimacy at the heart of what makes him such a magnetic artist.\n\nSet List\n\n\"When I Was a Young Girl\"\n\"Vampire Again\"\n\"What's Chasing You\"\n\"Make Way For Love\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nMarlon Williams (vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, keyboard); David Khan (vocals, electric guitar); Benjamin Woolley (vocals, bass); Angus Agars (vocals, drums)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Bronson Arcuri; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Bronson Arcuri, Morgan Noelle Smith, Tsering Bista, CJ Riculan; Production Assistant: Lee Mengitsu; Photo: Liam James Doyle/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ab8YnmHB6tE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ab8YnmHB6tE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ab8YnmHB6tE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ab8YnmHB6tE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ab8YnmHB6tE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":132,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Ab8YnmHB6tE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/AiAcMjkcSbS6azA3jv8mGZpl6w4\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjF3RldSNXFDQjJr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-17T13:00:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Randy Newman: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Oct. 10, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- I think Randy Newman is a national treasure. If he was just a funny guy making music, I'd be OK with that, but his wit is sardonic, satirical and politically on point. Mixing politics and humor with music is usually about the punchline, and his punchlines even make the singer smile.\n\nRandy Newman paints lasting portraits of places and people, all the while poking fun and highlighting injustice, stupidity, power and humanity and he's been doing it for half a century. Here are the opening lines to his recently released song \"Putin\":\n\n\"Putin puttin' his pants on / One leg at a time / You mean he's just like a regular fella, huh? / He ain't nothing like a regular fella.\"\nHis new album, Dark Matter, is his first batch of songs in nine years and there's more than the usual biting Newman wit; there's also a tender heart.

The Brooklyn-based band's songs are the initial creation of leader Adam Schatz, who observes the world with fresh, almost alien eyes. The songs can feel a bit drugged-out – a bit high and full of curiosity – but never overly intoxicated or out-of-touch.\n\nThe opening track for Landlady's Tiny Desk performance, \"Cadaver,\" has its origins in a friend of Schatz's who went to medical school, and the years she spent examining a single cadaver over and over and even more specifically about a tattoo on that cadaver's buttocks.\n\nLandlady is also a band of brilliant musicians who carefully craft their playing to serve the songs. Each player on their own might seem to be making quirky sounds or playing odd rhythms, but together they create head-turning tunes.\n\nFor their Tiny Desk Concert they came in as a foursome but also recruited the Washington D.C. string quartet, Rogue Collective to flesh-out their sound on the third song, \"Electric Abdomen.\" That cut, which seems to be about being uncomfortable in your own skin, sounds like it came from a long-lost tape from The Beatles during a session for Abbey Road, full of wonder and, like this Tiny Desk performance, worth digging deep into.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Cadaver\"\n\"Solid Brass\"\n\"Electric Abdomen\"\n\nMusicians\n\nAdam Schatz (keys, vocals); Will Graefe (guitar, vocals); Ryan Dugre (bass, vocals); Ian Chang (drums, vocals); Alexa Cantalupo (violin); Livia Amoruso (violin); Deanna Said (viola); Natalie Spehar (cello)\n\nCredits\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Bronson Arcuri; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Bronson Arcuri, Colin Marshall, Maia Stern, Tsering Bista; Production Assistant: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WEzNvKpMyvg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WEzNvKpMyvg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WEzNvKpMyvg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WEzNvKpMyvg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WEzNvKpMyvg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":134,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"WEzNvKpMyvg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/wbzjXg5R7KocKxYhfxr9QjtQGJ0\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLl90LW5SWHdBTDFr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-10T13:00:05.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Paramore: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Oct. 2, 2017 | Lars Gotrich -- Paramore's After Laughter captures the moment between rapture and its comedown, the glitter wiped away, left with skin rubbed raw. It's a record, more than a decade into the band's career, that not only exposes the sparkling pop that's always lit Paramore's songs, but also deals with the ache of growing up and growing apart. When Hayley Williams sings, \"Tell my friends I'm coming down / We'll kick it when I hit the ground\" from the '80s-tastic jam \"Hard Times\" at the Tiny Desk, the stark dichotomy is laid bare by the band's stripped-down performance that still packs a small synth and Zac Farro's drum machine into its Afro-pop-flecked textures.\n\nBacked here only by guitarist Taylor York, \"26\" is Williams' letter to a younger self, to still believe in dreams, knowing its costs. Paramore's quieter songs have never quite shown this depth of understated devastation and determination, and Williams reflects that nuance in a voice that scales the end of the line, \"And they say that dreaming is free,\" with just the slightest trail of regret.\n\nThese songs extend After Laughter's themes, racing across the spectrum of hope, with \"Fake Happy\" as a soaring anthem to expressing your truest self (and calling out those playing pretend). At the Tiny Desk, the shimmering guitars and synths almost become tropical, as if the band's all taken a big swig of Drake's \"Passionfruit\" and started a lowkey jam among friends.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Hard Times\"\n\"26\"\n\"Fake Happy\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nHayley Williams (vocals), Taylor York (guitar), Zac Farro (drum machine), Logan MacKenzie (keys), Joseph Howard (bass), Justin York (guitar)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Lars Gotrich Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Niki Walker, Maia Stern, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Salvatore Maicki; Photo: Christina Ascani/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_t-nRXwAL1k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_t-nRXwAL1k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_t-nRXwAL1k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_t-nRXwAL1k/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_t-nRXwAL1k/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":135,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_t-nRXwAL1k"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/AbPJI6K5wetICGS4bc-pnHymES8\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjhqdWJaUlVjUGpB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-06T13:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Dawg Yawp: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Sept. 29, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- A man in a black cape holds a sitar like a guitar all while singing a dreamy tale about wanting to be a dog.

At a time when dancehall has been dominating the Jamaican soundscape, its refreshing to hear the man born Jamar McNaughton carrying the roots-revival torch for a younger generation and expanding upon the footprint left by his world-renowned predecessors.\n\nChronixx and his band Zincfence Redemption paid a long-awaited visit to the Tiny Desk to perform three songs from his sophomore album, Chronology.\n\n\nSet List:\n\n\"Skankin' Sweet\"\n\"Majesty\"\n\"Spanish Town Rocking\"\n\nMusicians:\n\nJamar McNaughton \"Chronixx\" (vocals); Evan Mason (keys); Stephen Coore (guitar); N'Namdi Robinson (guitar); Hector Lewis (percussion); Adrian Henry (bass); Oliver Thompson (drums)\n\nCredits:\n\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Niki Walker, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Tsering Bista, Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri; Production Assistant: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFdebIZJah8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFdebIZJah8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFdebIZJah8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFdebIZJah8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFdebIZJah8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":137,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"tFdebIZJah8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/frgT8YVWIWfEkBg7HK0jg63EOIk\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlp5SGlwTDQ1cHdN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-02T13:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Sept. 25, 2017 | Robin Hilton -- It's hard to think of an artist who's brought more joy to more people, across more generations — and in more ways — than Steve Martin. In the 1970s, he won the hearts of young children for his playful appearances with The Muppets while simultaneously charming legions of older fans with his subversive standup routines. Later, as an actor, he wrote and starred in some of the most memorable comedies (and a few dramas) of all time, while writing books, plays and even a Broadway musical.\n\nThroughout his 50-year career, one constant in Steve Martin's life has been the banjo. It was a staple of his early standup shows and even fans who only wanted to laugh couldn't help but marvel at his playing. Over the years, he's continued to perform and record with country and bluegrass luminaries like Earl Scruggs, Dolly Parton, Vince Gill and others.\n\nThese days Martin is working on music full-time. He's just released a stellar bluegrass album he recorded with The Steep Canyon Rangers called (perfectly) The Long-Awaited Album, a record filled with often hilarious story songs and world-class performances.\n\nMartin's set with The Steep Canyon Rangers at the Tiny Desk was at times thrilling, particularly his opening solo for the song \"So Familiar.\" But it was also playful, comical and a joy to witness. At the end of the typical three-song performance, the group graciously decided to do one more called \"Caroline,\" a hilarious, first-person account of how not to handle a breakup.\n\nSet List\n\n\"So Familiar\"\n\"All Night Long\"\n\"On The Water\"\n\"Caroline\"\n\nMusicians\n\nSteve Martin (banjo, vocals), Woody Platt (guitar, vocals), Mike Ashworth (percussion), Mike Guggino (mandolin), Charles Humphrey (bass), Graham Sharp (banjo, vocals), Nicky Sanders (fiddle)\n\nCredits\n\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Niki Walker, Bronson Arcuri, Alyse Young; Production Assistant: Beck Harlan; Photo: Christina Ascani/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZyHipL45pwM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZyHipL45pwM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZyHipL45pwM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZyHipL45pwM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZyHipL45pwM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":138,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ZyHipL45pwM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/ozJopYx3fkQ9yG7BoXyRqWPMOQ8\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlFMUnhPOUFtTk5v","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-28T13:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"SsingSsing: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Sept. 21, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- One look at (and listen to) the cross-dressing, Asian rock band SsingSsing and you would hardly think they're singing music inspired by traditional Korean folk.

Hynes, the 31-year-old British producer and songwriter who performs under the name Blood Orange, makes hit records with Solange and Carly Rae Jepson. Glass, the 80-year-old Baltimore-born New Yorker who writes operas and film scores, is one of classical music's legendary artists.\n\nBut walk into Hynes' third floor loft in New York's Chinatown and you'll find a photo of Glass on his piano. Hynes, it turns out, is a fan. He discovered Glass' music by chance as a London teenager, when he bought the 1982 album Glassworks on the strength of its crystalline cover image alone. What he heard after he brought it home transfixed him. Today, he says Glass' influence \"seeps\" into his music — the interlocking marimba parts in \"Best to You\" or the feather light ostinato that ignites \"Better Than Me.\" Last year, he surprised a few ears when he played excerpts from Glass' solo piano suite Metamorphosis during a live session on SiriusXM.\n\nThis spring, Hynes invited Glass to his apartment where they sat at a piano, compared chords and traded stories. Ninety minutes later, their wide ranging conversation had touched on the pulse of New York City, the pains of striking out on your own as a musician, what role the arts play in society today and Hamilton. Plus about a hundred other ideas.\n\nPerhaps the most potent virtue Hynes and Glass share is an instinctive ear for collaboration. Glass has worked with everyone from Ravi Shankar and Paul Simon to dozens of filmmakers, dancers, poets and visual artists. Hynes moves adroitly, too. These days he pairs up with Sky Ferreira, FKA Twigs, Haim and ballet dancer Maria Kochetkova, but in his teens he joined a dance-punk band named Test Icicles, then moved on to the quirky folk-pop of Lightspeed Champion.\n\nMaybe it's that willingness to let something unknown percolate into a new idea. And maybe that's why these two musicians, some 50 years apart in age, decided to meet on a cloudy April afternoon in Chinatown to let yet another intriguing collaboration blossom.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PTzbz6layI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PTzbz6layI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PTzbz6layI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PTzbz6layI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PTzbz6layI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":140,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"7PTzbz6layI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/b65PwxiJ2OxX4o_nlCEdk9V0rLI\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjNvWS1HUVZ6QVg4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-29T13:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Bomba Estereo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Sept. 22, 2017 | Felix Contreras -- If the Tiny Desk offers one lesson, it's that greatness doesn't diminish with less volume.

They rumble at a steady pace like a scrappy rock band playing to a small room, but then Lindsey Jordan, who just graduated from high school this past spring, drops a line like, \"So if you look death right in the face, don't thank him / Because there's nothing and there won't ever be.\" You can feel the room nod in solidarity, and you could feel the NPR Music office do the same when Snail Mail performed \"Slug.\"\n\nEncouraged by punks in the Baltimore scene, Jordan started Snail Mail at 15 and released the quietly stunning Habit EP via Priests' in-house label last year. She's quickly found fans in Helium and Ex Hex's Mary Timony (who also happens to be Jordan's guitar teacher) and just went on tour with Waxahatchee and Palehound. Oh, and she once made blueberry pancakes with me on a short-lived NPR cooking show because clearly my kitchen is the path to success.\n\nJordan's joined in this performance by what's become her consistent live band (drummer Ray Brown and bassist Alex Russell), giving weight to both \"Slug\" and the soaring coming-of-age anthem \"Thinning.\" Because we often ask bands to turn down for the office space, she jokes, \"I guess I don't really know what we sound like because we're so loud. Now we're quiet and Ray's using the mallets and my guitar's all the way down — I was like, 'We sound like this?'\"\n\nJordan closes the set solo with a new song, \"Anytime.\" It is, perhaps typically for Snail Mail, slow and sad, but the alternate guitar tuning and Jordan's drawled vocal performance gives this song about a crush an aerial motion, like acrobats sliding down a long sheet of fabric.\n\nHabit is out now via Sister Polygon.

His songs are deliberate meanderings on the mundane and the poignancy in everyday life. And in the way Bob Dylan took his guitar and harmonica to accompany his rarely repeating ramblings, L.A Salami embraces a similar aesthetic, albeit as a black Englishman instead of a white Minnesotan.\n\nHis opening song at the Tiny Desk, \"Day to Day (For 6 Days a Week),\" runs about six minutes, with over 600 words. He seems to rattle them all off effortlessly, with compelling, complicated rhymes that never repeat and phrases such as:\n\n\"Went to work for the NHS -\n\nMental health, people depressed.\n\nMet Joanne - Scared of living,\n\nAfraid of dying, terrified of being.\n\nThen met Paul, a schizophrenic,\n\nShaking limbs, paranoid fanatic -\n\nUnwashed 10 days in a row -\n\nSo afraid almost paralytic.\"\n\nL.A. Salami released one of my favorite albums of 2016, Dancing With Bad Grammar, which was produce by Matt Ingram, known for his creative work with artists as diverse as Laura Marling and FKA Twigs.

It's only cool for them,'\" Antonoff said. It was offered as an apology — he had just finished aiming a monologue about the link between dancing and crying at a single NPR staffer in the audience — but it was also a perfect encapsulation of the connection Antonoff's songs create. Bleachers makes truly conversational pop, songs that sound expansive but retain a sense of intimacy, even when aimed at the masses.\n\nAt the Tiny Desk, Antonoff, along with pianist Mikey Hart and multi-instrumentalist Evan Smith, pared away much of the pomp that can turn Antonoff's layered studio productions into neon-lit melodramas rollercoastering toward catharsis. On three songs from this year's album Gone Now impeccably re-arranged for a smaller space, it was impossible to miss the cracked longing at the heart of Antonoff's work.\n\n\"If you ever see Bleachers live, it's two drum sets and it's big and it's kinda like this big statement that I could hide behind the tears with this big rock show. But the songs are written like this,\" Antonoff said before launching into a version of the '80s-drenched single \"Don't Take The Money\" that was all feathery keyboards and spoken word verses — plus a brief quote from Queen's 1984 hit \"Radio Ga Ga. \"\n\nNot that he could resist a well-placed gimmick. \"Don't Take The Money\" was the only song of the day to include drum sounds, which came from a cassette tape in a boom box over which a microphone had been draped. He started the song by hitting play on the cassette, but it took three tries to nail the ending in time with Hart.

On this summer's The Nashville Sound, the decorated Alabama-born star understandably casts his gaze toward parenthood — a job he's recently come to share with singer, fiddler and Tiny Desk veteran Amanda Shires — but expands his scope further to encompass politics, fear of obsolescence, and his place in the world. It's a gorgeous record: noble and scruffy, graceful and human.\n\nFor his Tiny Desk debut, Isbell and his band The 400 Unit performed three songs from The Nashville Sound, but their set fanned out to include lengthy bits of funny banter, a false start and an impromptu bit in which he shone a spotlight on a member of the audience. \"This is like an audition and a rock show at once,\" he deadpanned to Ashwin Wadekar, a guest in the building who — not to spoil anything — got more than he'd likely expected from his visit to NPR headquarters.\n\nThe Nashville Sound is available now.\niTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-nashville-sound/id1216344634\nAmazon - https://www.amazon.com/Nashville-Sound-Jason-Isbell-Unit/dp/B06XPLSGJF/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504704507&sr=8-1&keywords=the+nashville+sound\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Chaos and Clothes\"\n\n\"Molotov\"\n\n\"Last of My Kind\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nJason Isbell (vocals, guitar); Sadler Vaden (guitar); Amanda Shires (fiddle, backing vocals); Jimbo Hart (bass); Derry deBorja (keyboards); Chad Gamble (drums); Ashwin Wadekar (guitar on \"Last of My Kind\").\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Niki Walker, Bronson Arcuri; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, Jason Willetts; Videographers: Niki Walker, Tsering Bista; Production Assistant: Nick Michael; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djUh1eHdepE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djUh1eHdepE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djUh1eHdepE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djUh1eHdepE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djUh1eHdepE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":145,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"djUh1eHdepE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/anDliYU1br6x9ZlraY7c7GWU830\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLk5QbFpRNUw4eVVZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-15T13:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Frances Cone: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Sept. 8, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- When I listened blindly to nearly a thousand songs while attempting to make my schedule of bands to see at this year's SXSW music festival, one of the few tracks that leapt to the top was \"Arizona\" by Frances Cone. I wasn't alone. NPR Music's Stephen Thompson also singled out this now Brooklyn-based band for the way it wraps its storytelling in a catchy, pop parcel.\n\nLed by singer and songwriter Christina Cone, the band is set to release Late Riser, its second full-length album, later this year. The first track the group performed for this Tiny Desk concert is its just-released single, \"Unraveling,\" a tale of falling apart, of life becoming so overwhelming that the song's character simply stops and lets go.\n\nWith each verse of \"Unraveling\" the saga builds to a climax and then a calm. It's this sort of craft that makes Frances Cone stand out. Think Lucius, another band that captured my attention years ago for similar reasons. In fact, Dan Molad, the drummer and producer for Lucius, mixed that first Frances Cone song that grabbed my attention, \"Arizona.\" This is wonderfully literate pop that won't hit you over the head, but might gently find a home in your heart.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Unraveling\"\n\"Arizona\"\n\"Leave Without You\"\n\nMusicians\n\nChristina Cone (keys, vocals); Andrew Doherty (electric bass, electric guitar, vocals); Adam Melchor (electric guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals); Alex Baron (drums)\n\nCredits\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Niki Walker, Morgan Noelle Smith; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Tsering Bista; PA: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/ti...","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NPlZQ5L8yUY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NPlZQ5L8yUY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NPlZQ5L8yUY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NPlZQ5L8yUY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NPlZQ5L8yUY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":146,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NPlZQ5L8yUY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/BX57qb80uv8WFnw5dkgUZUp7xC0\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLmgtX1lFaWFjNTVz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-11T13:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Jidenna: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Sept. 5, 2017 | Bobby Carter -- \"Classic Man,\" the 2015 debut single from Nigerian-American MC Jidenna, caught everyone off guard. The song found him teetering between rapping and singing about elegance, politeness and Nat \"King\" Cole, and the melody felt irresistible. Then there's the look: He rocks thrift-wear tailored to a T. The song eventually went double platinum and earned a Grammy nomination. Jidenna followed it with a few more club bangers before releasing his debut album, The Chief, earlier this year. A tribute to his father, a Nigerian chief, the record is peppered with African rhythms and themes.\n\nJidenna and his band recently visited NPR to perform three reworked selections from The Chief. They excitedly explored every nook and cranny of the Tiny Desk in search of props, eventually settling on a toy, the magic microphone, a tambourine and a bottle of whiskey.

It's a security blanket, a bit of visual branding, a statement of stylistic intent — and, not for nothing, a big reason ALA.NI's voice carries with such warmth and intimacy.\n\nThe microphone isn't the only element of ALA.NI's sound that seems to have been transported from another era. The London-born, Paris-based singer draws inspiration from her uncle, a British '20s and '30s cabaret star by the name of Leslie \"Hutch\" Hutchinson, and writes her own songs in the style of the standards he sang. You & I, her debut album, reverberates from the same spirit: It captures and conveys a reverent love of early-20th-century music, while injecting those sounds with charisma and charm well suited for any era. Here, she performs four songs from You & I, before closing her set with a heartwarming, crowd-aided \"Happy Birthday\" to her accompanist, Marvin Dolly.\n\nYou & I is available now. \niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/you-i/id1209128772\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/You-I-ALA-NI/dp/B06WWC9NCM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1502459668&sr=8-1&keywords=ala.ni\n\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Cherry Blossom\"\n\"Ol Fashioned Kiss\"\n\"Suddenly\"\n\"Happy Birthday (To Marvin)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nALA.NI (vocals, guitar); Marvin Dolly (guitar)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Niki Walker, Bronson Arcuri; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Tsering Bista; PA: Karen Gwee; Photo: Liam James Doyle/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Oy3pyPxRo0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Oy3pyPxRo0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Oy3pyPxRo0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Oy3pyPxRo0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Oy3pyPxRo0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":148,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9Oy3pyPxRo0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Oo3eQmSsW1qOLBs4xHR6DLIZKy4\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlB2bjIwUGpCYTNr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-28T13:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"DJ Premier & The Badder Band: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Aug 21, 2017 | Abby O'Neill | Three-time Grammy winner DJ Premier, one of the definitive architects of New York hip-hop, brought a new type of life to NPR's Tiny Desk: our first concert helmed by a DJ.\n\nA packed house of head-nodding journalists grooved through their lunch hour to a nine-song medley of iconic Premier productions while decompressing from the unrelenting grind of the news cycle. The set list rested on the undeniable footprint of Preemo's classics, but this was more than just another DJ mix. His touring outfit, The Badder Band, overlaid Premier's blends with an undulating electric bass courtesy of Brady Watt, a steady accent on the one from drummer Lenny \"The Ox\" Reece and boisterous horns from Mark Williams and Jonathan Powell.\n\nBut it was Premier who remained front-and-center, commanding the crowd like a true party rocker. With throwbacks ranging from Gangstarr's \"Step into the Arena\" to an amped rendition of Jeru The Damaja's \"Da Bitches,\" embellished by The Badder's jazzy horns, Preemo concluded the set with a \"Moment of Truth,\" featuring the exalted rhymes of his posthumous Gangstarr partner, Guru.\n\nTiny Desk concerts are short by design, so naturally the format could barely scratch the surface of Premier's vault of street anthems, done for the likes of the Notorious B.I.G., JAY-Z, Nas, Kanye West, Big L, M.O.P., Mos Def, Group Home, Jeru the Damaja, AZ, Snoop Dogg, and many more.

But in the case of Aldous Harding it's in the spaces, the pauses, and her unique delivery. Watch her Tiny Desk Concert and you can see this in her facial expressions and body posture.\n\nThe first song she performs,\"Imagining My Man,\" is about what she calls the \"tender and frightening thoughts that come with being in love,\" and what you witness while watching her are often painful, pensive expressions that are as important to the song as the notes being played.\n\nAldous Harding is a singer from New Zealand who's inspired by British folk singer Vashti Bunyan, but making something truly unique and her own. Party, her second album, is full of deeply personal songs with memorable melodies and spare instrumentation that linger in my head long after the headphone batteries have drained. It'll certainly be a favorite on my year-end list.\n\nAldous Harding's musical partner for the Tiny Desk is Jared Samuel, a keyboardist who was so impressive at SXSW this year in the band, Invisible Familiars. It's his deft accompaniment on these songs that shapes the texture and pulse of them, adding tension to already taut tunes. Aldous Harding's music isn't universal, but if you lean toward loving the poetic, the melodic and the mysterious, you'll likely love it.\n\nParty is available now. \niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/party/id1214279887\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Party-Aldous-Harding/dp/B06XX6XS8X\n\nSet List\n\n\"Imagining My Man\"\n\"Blend\"\n\"Horizon\"\n\nMusicians\n\nAldous Harding (guitar, vocals); Jared Elioseff (keyboard, vocals)\n\nCredits\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Tsering Bista; Video Editor: Bronson Arcuri; PA: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U6ToeaeuOQo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U6ToeaeuOQo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U6ToeaeuOQo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U6ToeaeuOQo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U6ToeaeuOQo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":152,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"U6ToeaeuOQo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/BqX6M78ZVFJS_42uBjpUp_kSYjE\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLlRpZDBubHdmdkFJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-07T13:00:05.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"The Shins: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Bob Boilen | July 24, 2017 -- The Shins have been a constant part of NPR's musical DNA for much of the 21st century.

It's a moving performance with just James on guitar, no band, no amplification - simple and perfect.\n\nHeartworms is available now. \niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/heartworms/id1187341560\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Heartworms-Shins/dp/B01MT1FVSJ\n\nSet List\n\n\"Mildenhall\"\n\"The Fear\"\n\"Young Pilgrims\"\n\nMusicians\n\nJames Mercer (vocals, guitar)\n\nCredits\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Tsering Bista; Video Editor: Tsering Bista; PA: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tid0nlwfvAI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tid0nlwfvAI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tid0nlwfvAI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tid0nlwfvAI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tid0nlwfvAI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":153,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Tid0nlwfvAI"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Q0fT42P9bR7xMZBvYvrsd5WpJPA\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLmtjMmk5cHdTU3FF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-04T13:00:30.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Albin Lee Meldau: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Robin Hilton | July 20, 2017 -- Few singers can command an audience's attention quite like Albin Lee Meldau. When I first saw him perform, at a church in Austin, Texas during South By Southwest last March, it felt like the entire audience was on the edge of its seat, hanging on every twisted word. His voice is breathtaking, soulful, thunderous and impossible to ignore.\n\nWatching Meldau in this Tiny Desk set, the first thing you'll notice, apart from that voice, is how possessed he is by the music. The words and melodies seem to take hold of him while at the same time offering a release, if only for a moment, from the knot of emotions he's carrying inside. It's in no small part because Meldau's music is so personal, centered on desperate souls in deeply troubled times. \"Lou Lou,\" the track he opens with and his most popular song, is a story of drug addiction and mental illness, inspired by a girl he knew while growing up in Sweden. He calls \"Bloodshot,\" the track he closes with, \"dark and horrible,\" about the wreckage of a tortured relationship and the crazed paranoia of jealousy. His other two songs, \"Mayfly\" and \"Persistence,\" are more about hanging on when it seems there's nothing left to live for.\n\nMeldau grew up in Gothenburg, Sweden the son of musical parents. His mother is a music teacher and jazz singer, while Meldau says his father is a \"punk rocker.\" (Both write and record their own songs.) As a kid, Meldau originally played trumpet but mostly dreamed of being a professional soccer player. Now, as a full-time musician, he says his dream was to play the Tiny Desk.\n\n\"It's a deep honor to be here,\" Meldau told the NPR audience. \"I've been to the BBC and now I've been here, so now I can die.\" So far, Albin Lee Meldau has released two EPs — Lovers late last year and Bloodshot, out today (July 21) on Astralwerks — with a debut full-length out later this year.\n\nBloodshot is available now. \niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bloodshot-ep/id1259591242 \nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073XBB1T4/ref=dm_ws_sp_ps_dp\n\nSet List\n\n\"Lou Lou\"\n\"Mayfly\"\n\"Persistence\"\n\"Bloodshot\"\n\nMusicians\n\nAlbin Lee Meldau (vocals, guitar); Kalle Stenbäcken (keys, drums); Simon Andermo (bass, auxiliary percussion); Simon Söfelde (drums)\n\nCredits\n\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Tsering Bista; PA: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kc2i9pwSSqE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kc2i9pwSSqE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kc2i9pwSSqE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kc2i9pwSSqE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kc2i9pwSSqE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":154,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"kc2i9pwSSqE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/QJ7GksW3yrKzKNeXQpvYVqWXHFM\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnlzR0VyWmNaUkdZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-02T13:00:31.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Rare Essence: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Suraya Mohamed | July 19, 2017 — Dominated by drive and momentum, heavy on percussion and bass, go-go music is all about the beat. Live, \"songs\" can continue on for half an hour, as the percussion continues to simmer and punctuate between and across different pieces. \"That's why we call it go-go, because it goes on and goes on and goes on,\" as guitarist Andre Johnson put it in a documentary film.\n\nWhile the Tiny Desk doesn't allow for that kind of expansive get-down — though they did play seven songs — this visit by Rare Essence perfectly encapsulated the genre's incomparable meld of soul, R&B and, most importantly, funk (with a dash of Afro-Cuban influence).\n\nRare Essence emerged not long after go-go itself did, beginning as a group in 1976 in Washington D.C. Ever since the group has kept a steady schedule playing around town and around the world — they have ten shows scheduled for the month of July alone.\n\nAt the Tiny Desk, the group's closer brought everyone home — much too soon, no matter how late — with \"Overnight Scenario,\" a classic.

Rarely has a news organization had this much fun.\n\nIt was the real-life breakup of band leader Brently Heilborn that led to the formation of the woefully woven band Fragile Rock. But these aren't just any puppets — no. They are emo puppets, armed with drums and guitars and glum tales to tell, with songs like \"Wake Up to the Breakup\" and \"I Am Sad (And So Am I)\" that which draw from the spastic boogie of The B-52s and the laments of The Smiths. At one point, you'll see Fragile Rock empty a bag of \"bloodied\" socks, tossing them into the crowd, before breaking into the song \"Socks Are Murder,\" a playful take on The Smiths' thoughtful \"Meat Is Murder.\"\n\nAnd in the spirit of the day Fragile Rock managed to crowd surf a puppet bringing giggles to a crowd of reporters, editors and friends, while puppets depicting NPR hosts Susan Stamberg, Michel Martin and Robert Siegel (the latter actually received a playful kiss from none other than Nina Totenberg) — all created by NPR's own puppet master Barry Gordemer — objectively observed.\n\nFragile Rock's album Wake Up To The Breakup is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wake-up-to-the-breakup/id1259362679\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Wake-Up-Breakup-Fragile-Rock/dp/B073X59HHV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1500494546&sr=8-1&keywords=Fragile+Rock+Wake+Up\n\nSetlist\n\"Wakeup To The Breakup\"\n\"Socks Are Murder\"\n\"Fairuza Balk\"\n\nMusicians\nMilo S.

Seattle-based producer Jake One has a who's-who client list, from Rick Ross to 21 Savage — while DJ, singer-songwriter and producer Mayer Hawthorne is a renaissance soul man from Ann Arbor, Michigan. They stealthily debuted three tracks on SoundCloud in 2013 with only a black square stamped \"Tuxedo\" as the cover art, leaving fans wondering where this new funk was coming from. A few months later they unveiled their identities along with a debut self-titled LP, resurrecting a sound popularized by greats like The Gap Band, The Fatback Band and Roger Troutman.\n\nWhen Tuxedo arrived at NPR and Mayer Hawthorne spied a small 'Ho!' button sitting on Bob Boilen's desk, he immediately beamed. \"We use a big 'Ho!' button on tour,\" he said. They didn't bring a drummer, opting for a boombox — yes, a real boombox playing a real cassette tape, kids — and it was nostalgic delight from the start of the cassette's hiss. The band was tight as ever, while their ace in the hole, Gavin Turek provided dance moves and the sweetest harmonies. Tuxedo set things off with a fan favorite from their first album, along with two from their latest, before closing it out with a red light special. It's one thing to go against the grain for the sake of it — and another completely make it good. In this Tiny Desk concert, Tuxedo accomplished both.\n\nDo It is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tuxedo-ii/id1193391674\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Tuxedo-II/dp/B01N5WKIYY\n\nSetlist\n\"Do It\"\n\"Second Time Around\"\n\"July\"\n\nMusicians\nMayer Hawthorne (vocals, keys);

He wrote a poem. More specifically, he wrote a poem in the short time it took him to ride from his hotel in Washington, D.C. to the NPR Music offices. Calling it \"The Other Side,\" Chance debuted it in the middle of his remarkable set, reading from his notes written out in black marker on sheets of typing paper.\n\n\"I still have all the keys that are of no use to me,\" he began. \"They used to, though. On the other side was a mansion on a hill, complete with L.A. pools and fireplaces and a rim made specifically for people that lie about being six feet to dunk on.\"\n\nChance didn't get much further before he was interrupted by one of the hazards of performing in an actual, working office: a building-wide page for someone to call the mailroom. But Chance rolled with it, cracking a quick joke before starting over again.\n\nThe night before arriving for his Tiny Desk set, Chance performed for more than 23,000 people at Jiffy Lube Live, an outdoor theater in Bristow, VA. The sold out arena and amphitheater shows of his current tour offer a stark contrast to the first time I saw Chance in concert back in 2013. Then, he was a 19-year old upstart rapping and singing for a handful of people at a tiny club in Austin, Texas. A lot has changed since then, and quickly. Chance's most recent mix tape, Coloring Book, was widely ranked among the best albums of 2016 (some called it a masterpiece) and featured collaborations with a cast of hip-hop luminaries, from Kanye West to Lil Wayne and T-Pain.\n\nChance's poem \"The Other Side\" was sandwiched between an opening version of \"Juke Jam\" from Coloring Book and another special gift just for his Tiny Desk appearance, a moving cover of Stevie Wonder's 1974 song \"They Won't Go When I Go.\"\n\nColoring Book is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/coloring-book/id1113239004\nSpotify: https://play.spotify.com/album/71QyofYesSsRMwFOTafnhB\n\nSet List\n\"Juke Jam\"\n\"They Won't Go When I Go\" (written by Stevie Wonder)\n\nMusicians\nChance The Rapper (vocals); Nico Segal (trumpet); Peter Wilkins (keys); Rachele Robinson (background vocals); Ben Lusher (background vocals); Elliot Skinner (background vocals); Richard Saunders (background vocals); Greg Landfair Jr., aka \"Stix\" (drums)\n\nCredits\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Nick Michael, Morgan Noelle Smith, Tsering Bista; PA: Colin Marshall, Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-kWbZvVU-e0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-kWbZvVU-e0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-kWbZvVU-e0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-kWbZvVU-e0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-kWbZvVU-e0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":163,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-kWbZvVU-e0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/OxDPFN5tXLBRC-x8XDjS_DCznEE\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLnJESmVZTWVsODFZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-19T13:00:04.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Jay Som: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Bob Boilen | July 10, 2017 — Jay Som is the project of 23-year-old Melina Duterte, who has been creating music for the past 10 years or so on a multitude of instruments, from guitar to trumpet.

It was a sound I had never quite heard, and I was immediately drawn in; there were layers of synths, percussion that percolated rather than pulsed, vocals that epitomized the world ethereal and lyrics in Spanish and English that floated amidst the music like wisps of smoke.\n\nI caught his live show in Mexico City and in Austin, Texas and each time the spectacle of theater and elaborate presentation were just as important as the music (including two dancers covered in what can best be described as Christmas tree tinsel).\n\nBut that's not what you're getting here — instead of tinsel, we get Roberto standing behind Bob Boilen's desk in a t-shirt that says \"Young, Latin and Proud,\" the title of his most recent single. That's the essence of the songs he chose to play (and really, his entire catalog), music about being a young American with Ecuadorian parents, singing about life in here in the U.S.\n\nOur little concert here also shows off an acoustic treatment of Helado Negro's vision, and it's just as compelling without the electronics. In fact, it's as if the songs reveal a different aspect of themselves, the lyrics intimate and laid bare. Personally, I loved the sound of the alto and tenor saxophones playing harmonies in place of a bank of keyboards. As you'll see, the entire band perfected that delicate balance of intensity and low volume, letting the music and ideas breathe.\n\nThis performance was a long time in the making, but the payoff is clear, presenting an artist in full command of his craft.\n\nPrivate Energy is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/private-energy-expanded/id1221972520\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Private-Energy-Expanded-Helado-Negro/dp/B06XKYFKJM\n\nSet List\n\"Transmission Listen\"\n\"Young, Latin and Proud\"\n\"Run Around\"\n\"It's My Brown Skin\"\n\nMusicians\nRoberto Lange (vocals, guitar); Nathaniel Morgan (sax); Angela Morris (sax, violin); Ben Lanz (bass guitar); Weston Minissali (synthesizer); Jason Nazary (drums)\n\nCredits\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame; PA: CJ Riculan; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p0x3aKmEu7M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p0x3aKmEu7M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p0x3aKmEu7M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p0x3aKmEu7M/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p0x3aKmEu7M/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":165,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"p0x3aKmEu7M"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/JBgqYRQCJAC8odFM471BCcK3hqo\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLk5FVUQyQ2tLbjhv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-03T13:00:05.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Ravi Coltrane Quartet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Suraya Mohamed | June 26, 2017 — Yes, Ravi Coltrane is the son of the John Coltrane, one of the most famous and important jazz saxophonists and composers of all time. He's also the son of multi-instrumentalist, composer and spiritual leader Alice Coltrane Turiyasangitananda. (In fact, all members of the band here are performing artists in their own right and come from artistically rich families; drummer E.J. Strickland is the brother of saxophonist Marcus Strickland; Adam Rogers parents performed on Broadway and Yunior Terry is Yosvany Terri's brother, both heirs to Cuban music royalty.) But pedigree is not what makes him (or them) special. It's the ability to draw on ideology and theory from the past and give already-great music the room to transform. As Coltrane told NPR back in 2013:\n\nAs improvisers, that's really our goal — not just to state the themes that people wrote. In the course of time, night after night you search for better ways to present the music.\nNot only did Coltrane and his band offer new interpretations from his repertoire, but varied the rhythmic presentations of the numbers, too. The first song in the set, \"Cobbs Hill,\" was written by Coltrane's good friend and colleague Ralph Alessi. Beginning with Yunior Terry's funky and deliberate bass line, further enhanced by intentional drum rolls the 2/4 time signature, two beats per measure, captures a march-like proclamation.\n\nThe second song is Coltrane's own composition, \"Three For Thee\", a fan favorite from the 1998 Moving Pictures album; the original recording included Ralph Alessi on trumpet. Only 32 years old when that record was released, it could be taken as a sign of things to come: Ravi Coltrane, an old soul in a young body, mature and capable of creating work so robust and important. Almost 20 years later, hearing that music again here, even better, is affirming and a testament to Coltrane's ever-evolving artistic journey. And E.J. Strickland's opening drum intro couldn't be more spunky; he teases the audience into the groove with effortless, intentional punctuations.\n\nThis performance is likely to be a historical footnote in the book of great jazz moments. The quartet demonstrates its marvelous technical capabilities and keen musicianship, and their imaginative interpretations suggest strength and resolve, a fluid embodiment of question and answer, push and pull, and rising action followed by hypnagogic culmination.\n\nIn Movement is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-movement/id1099363356\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Movement-Jack-DeJohnette/dp/B01CP7WXDW\n\nSet List\n\"Cobbs Hill\"\n\"In Three For Thee\"\n\"Phrygia\"\n\nMusicians\nRavi Coltrane (sax); Adam Rogers (guitar); Yunior Cabrera (bass); EJ Strickland (drums)\n\nCredits\nProducers: Suraya Mohamed, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Morgan Noelle Smith; PA: Bria Granville; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEUD2CkKn8o/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEUD2CkKn8o/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEUD2CkKn8o/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEUD2CkKn8o/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEUD2CkKn8o/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":166,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NEUD2CkKn8o"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/0TvjpFzU4wcjfphmtNg2BYBLxFI\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjVxLWNkZjQxNzBB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-06-30T13:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Holly Macve: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Stephen Thompson | June 23, 2017 — Holly Macve's voice seems to hover from era to era, coming to rest somewhere between the lonesome twang of Patsy Cline and the moodily modern slur of Lana Del Rey.

Its origins date back to the early '70s, within fever dreams Simon Jeffes had that were brought on by food poisoning. In those dreams he imagined a dispassionate world \"where everyone lived in big concrete blocks and spent their lives looking into screens. In one room, there was a couple making love lovelessly. In another there was a musician sat at a vast array of equipment, but with headphones on, so there was no actual music in the room.\" Eerily accurate.\n\nBut he also imagined a place, the Penguin Cafe, where folks could gather, for pleasure, cheer and music. He wanted to hear what that music would sound like, and so created the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. I was always a huge fan of that original music; listeners of NPR may have heard it often in-between news stories during the many years I directed All Things Considered.\n\nWhile Simon Jeffes died in 1997, his son Arthur has been creating new music infused with his father's original inspiration. He calls his group, simply, Penguin Cafe. You can hear Brazilian sounds in the rhythms, classical and minimalism in the strings, Asia in its harmonium, African sounds in the kalimbas.

The songs, much like frontman Mike Hadreas himself, are strong, but not hard. As he worked his way through two new tracks (\"Valley,\" \"Slip Away\") and one older (\"Normal Song\"), there were moments that were both beautiful and unnerving, in no small part because the songs are so deeply personal. Hadreas, who years ago battled addiction and a parade of inner demons before finding love and an ever-expanding confidence, wrote much of No Shape as a love letter to his boyfriend (and Perfume Genius keyboardist) Alan Wyffels.\n\nOn \"Valley,\" Hadreas reflects on the creeping past as he sings, \"How long must we live right / before we don't even have to try?\" On \"Slip Away,\" he celebrates having emerged on the other side of darkness: \"Don't hold back, I want to break free, God is singing through your body, and I'm carried by the sound.\" But Hadreas saved the most powerful moment for the final song, as guitarist Tom Bromley and percussionist Herve Becart stepped away from the Tiny Desk, leaving just him and Wyffels on keys as the two played \"Normal Song,\" a profoundly moving plea for strength in the face of an always uncertain future. \"Take my hand when you are scared and I will pray,\" sings Hadreas. \"... And no secret, no matter how nasty, can poison your voice or keep you from joy.\"\n\nThe fourth full-length from Perfume Genius, No Shape, was released May 5 on Matador Records.

But, while that band is on hiatus, Martin took time to walk into the world of Violents, the project of pianist, string arranger and songwriter Jeremy Larson. Larson and Martin make a lovely pair and have created a subtle, soulful record — Awake And Pretty Much Sober — that benefits greatly from Laron's classical training.\n\nIt's the first full-length Jeremy Larson has released as Violents, a project that, generally, sees him joined by a different singer each outing, resulting in an EP. Clearly there was a chemistry driving these sessions, inspiring and stretching the two artists into creating a full-sized work.\n\nHere at the Tiny Desk they performed with the string quartet Rootstock Republic, which they only had met earlier in the week. In fact, this was filmed during the first week Violents had ever performed live! It's a special collaboration you shouldn't miss — actually I almost did, running from a late train, coming from New York. If Stephen Thompson had not stopped the band to wait just a few minutes I'd have missed this rare treat.

So you'd be forgiven for watching the band perform \"Sugar For The Pill\" and struggling to pin down what era you're in — especially since NPR Music plopped the group in a playfully retro Brooklyn shuffleboard parlor for the occasion.\n\nIn the early '90s, Slowdive dressed up shoegaze's hazy drift with jolts of energy and a chiming dream-pop shimmer. The band lasted only three albums before splitting up in 1995, at which point members Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell formed the more countrified Mojave 3. Now, after reuniting in 2014, it's back with a self-titled album that picks up where it left off — but, while it conjures many signifiers of '90s college radio, the band's return album freshens the project up, too, with bright, impeccable songcraft. A patient mid-tempo gem that's as hooky as it is hypnotic, \"Sugar For The Pill\" is a particular highlight, so it's a joy to watch the reconstituted band trot it out for this Field Recording, filmed at Royal Palms Shuffleboard in Brooklyn.\n\nThe band will be on tour through the summer and fall.\n\nCredits:\n\nProducers: Ben Naddaff-Hafrey, Annabel Edwards; Director: Mito Habe-Evans; Editor: Nickolai Hammar; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Annabel Edwards, Mito Habe-Evans, Becky Lettenberger, Christopher Parks; Series Producer: Mito Habe-Evans; Executive Producers: Anya Grundmann, Keith Jenkins; Special Thanks: Mark and Rachel Dibner of the Argus Fund.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-tWhPv2U6aQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-tWhPv2U6aQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-tWhPv2U6aQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-tWhPv2U6aQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-tWhPv2U6aQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":172,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-tWhPv2U6aQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/AQGTaZagnt9Xzoqwi3ieZlCy8wc\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLjNjbzNMckI3bHV3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-06-08T14:33:18.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Interview with Sufjan Stevens, Bryce Dessner, Nico Muhly: NPR Music","description":"Advisory: This video contains profanity.\n\nThe trio talk about the grand mysteries of the universe that helped inspire their celestial collaboration, Planetarium.\n\nBy Bob Boilen\n\nThere's a stunning project by a handful of music's current big-thinkers: composer Nico Muhly, songwriter and singer Sufjan Stevens and guitarist-composer Bryce Dessner of The National.

The work was originally composed on commission for the Dutch concert hall Muziekgebouw Eindhoven, and first performed there in 2012. Five turns around the sun later, Planetarium will arrive in recorded form on June 9 via 4AD.\n\n\"Mercury\" is one of the most intimate songs on the record, a quality that's emphasized by its spot just after the 15-minute, ambient, electronic epic, \"Earth.\" Where the record's other songs foreground synthesizers and spastic electric drum samples reminiscent of 2010's The Age of Adz, \"Mercury\" largely rests on Muhly's gentle piano work and Stevens' beautiful vocal. Where once, in the original live performances, the song swelled to a cinematic rush on the order of Illinois, it's now spare and elegant. Its warm intimacy is all the more apparent in the group's live performance, which features Dessner of The National lightly doubling on guitar Stevens' wordless refrain at the song's close.\n\nLike many of the pieces on the record, its lyrics are a constellation of the cosmic, the personal and the mythological. The song, named for the messenger god, is a perfect musical setting for the feeling of having something dear carried away from you. \"All that I've known to be of life / and I am gentle,\" Stevens sings. \"You ran off with it all.\"\n\n\"Life is so abundant here, and yet we're so obsessed with the exterior of here,\" Stevens told All Songs Considered's Bob Boilen in a companion interview. \"That's what's so interesting, there's a sort of beautiful, perfect order to life on earth that's so mysterious and so profound. And yet, as people, we really fuck it up. We're so dysfunctional. And we seek guidance from the exterior world — from the heavens — to help us understand our purpose here, and to sort of create a sense of order.\"\n\nCredits:\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Ben Naddaff-Hafrey; Director: Mito Habe-Evans; Editor: Nickolai Hammar; Violist: Nadia Sirota; Audio Engineering: Daniel Availa, Fritz Myers, Josh Rogosin, James Yost; Videographers: Annabel Edwards, Mito Habe-Evans, Nickolai Hammar; Series Producer: Mito Habe-Evans; Executive Producers: Anya Grundmann, Keith Jenkins; Special Thanks: St. Rose Music, Mark and Rachel Dibner of the Argus Fund;","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YG8wLT8SFiw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YG8wLT8SFiw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YG8wLT8SFiw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YG8wLT8SFiw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YG8wLT8SFiw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"UU4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","position":174,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YG8wLT8SFiw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/49-4JApSkSc996jGvYPk0hazI5k\"","id":"VVU0ZVlYaEpJNC03d1NXYzhVTlJ3RDRBLmdGSU1VNHZ6aTJR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-06-09T13:00:03.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Nick Grant: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Rodney Carmichael | June 2, 2017 — We already knew Nick Grant was a sick lyricist.

The meticulousness of his work is clear on his debut album, Jardin, a three-year creative process in which Gabriel plays most of the instruments, tracking them to two-inch tape, layering its overall sound. Jardin takes its title as an umbrella; fruits, bugs and other plants are the driving metaphors tying together this dense work, which blooms over successive listens. Garzón-Montano doesn't necessarily wear his heart on his sleeve — he forces you to listen and peel the layers back.\n\nGarzón-Montano's career trajectory veers wide — living with Philip Glass for a year while his late mother played in the composer's ensemble, sitting under the minimal maestro's piano as he practiced; Lenny Kravitz making possible his first tour experience; while Drake exposed Gabriel's sound to the masses.\n\nThat decision to go it alone at the Tiny Desk made sense, though, the moment he started to play; his talent is left elegantly exposed in this unadorned performance.

New York, Tokyo — even Havana. But not CDMX (the new abbreviation of Ciudad de Mexico).\n\nThere is, though, a fairly rich history of jazz in the country, going back to a guy named Tino Contreras, who has been swinging since the late 1940's (sadly no longer active) through to the Toussaint brothers (Eugenio, Enrique, Fernando), who formed a way cool fusion band, Sacbe, in the late '70s. There have been others, of course, but never enough to make Mexico a place known for jazz — until now.\n\nThe young lions of Troker hail from Guadalajara, in the north of the country, but call CDMX their home now. From that home base they are making the rounds of festivals, clubs and concerts around the world, gathering fans of their smart, creative and singular brand of jazz.\n\nAs you'll see on this Tiny Desk, this is music you can dance to. In fact, when I saw them slay a post-midnight crowd at this year's SXSW, trumpeter Isaias Flores was a dancing machine, twisting and grooving to the band's mix of swing, funk, ska, psychedelic and Mexican music.\n\nThe band's compositions are journeys — as you watch them live, keep in mind that you are indeed witnessing history being made.

In a conversation we had, he described a medical condition related to tinnitus. He'd experienced the ringing before, but this was even more intense. \"I don't even know if ringing is really the right way to describe it, because it really sounded more like rushing water. This was at a level I'd never experienced before and it was really all-consuming, it took over. Playing music at all was out of the question. The sound of my own voice reverberating in my head was very painful — I had to just be more or less silent while this was happening.\"\n\nAfter a time, he tried to make music again. \"I started trying to play again and trying to sing again, testing where the boundary was of the sensitivity and of the pain. What I found was that if I sang very quietly and if I played guitar very quietly, that this would be a path for me.\" The result is his first solo album under his own name, a record called Impermanence. These are songs in slow motion; the builds are less about crescendo and more about subtle change. Peter is joined by Timothy Mislock, a former guitarist for The Antlers.

The first time alt-J played the Tiny Desk, in 2012, they came as a four-piece; electric guitar, bass, keyboards and drums. They were a pretty new band, their album had been out a few months and they were playing in clubs for a couple hundred people, not much more.\n\nIn the five years since the band visited it has found quite a few new fans. When I heard cuts from the newest album Relaxer a few months ago I flipped and tried to think of a way to bring them back. So I wrote them, saying I'd love to have them again but that it would have to be wholly, out-of-the-box different. I told them I'd hire a brass band, an African kora player if need be, a string section... They took up the challenge. They told me to find a cellist and two violinists.\n\nI wrote to my friend Carol Anne Bosco, a cellist, who turned out to be a huge fan of the band and helped find two violinists for the performance. About four days before the performance the band sent the string parts, written by their friend Will Gardner.\n\nOn Monday morning, the English band met the American string players and they all gathered behind my desk. As they worked their way through a first pass at \"Three Worn Words,\" I noticed them and relieved — alt-J had actually never heard the string arrangements, this was the first time. They sounded beautiful. By noon, NPR employees and friends gathered around my desk to witness this astonishing concert from alt-J, including two new songs and two old favorites.

So let's not use that label on the brilliant, wide-ranging music of Ljova and the Kontraband, a group that embraces Western classical, jazz and an array of international styles including tango and Eastern European and Balkan folk music. These top-flight musicians, who hail from Russia, Lithuania, the U.S. and Switzerland, pile all of these sounds atop of each other with great glee, and emerge with creations that alight on totally new and exciting terrain.\n\nThe band is led by the composer, arranger and viola player Ljova (Lev Zhurbin), who comes by this musical eclecticism naturally: the Moscow native, who comes from a family heavily involved in the arts, has worked with an astonishingly wide and starry group of collaborators, including Jay Z, the Bollywood queen Asha Bhosle and cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble. In this Kontraband setting, he and his bandmates (including Ljova's wife, the preternaturally sweet-voiced, Lithuanian-born singer Inna Barmash) create performances of deep earthiness, fragile tenderness, ebullient humor and quicksilver shifts in texture. But the heart of their Tiny Desk Concert was the song \"By the Campfire,\" whose words have a long, strange history that goes back to the Middle Ages. The words originally come from 12th-century Germany; Ljova's grandfather, a noted translator, translated this poem from German to Russian, which Ljova uses in his musical setting.\n\nBut before she sang \"By the Campfire,\" Barmash gave us her own English translation of this unsettling, stunning, and perhaps even prophetic text: \"Lies and spite command the world / Suffocate its consciousness, / Truth is poisoned, dead is law / Honor killed — obscene extolled! / ... And the wisdom of our days / Teaches theft, deceit and hate.\"\n\nNo Refund on Flowers is available now.

I thought I had a lot of energy — watching her bounce from guitar to drum machine to two separate microphones — and then hopping barefoot from looping pedal to effect pedal as she builds her songs was exhilarating and exhausting.
