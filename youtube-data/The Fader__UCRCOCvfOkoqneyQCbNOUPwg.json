When I ask the 29-year-old visual and installation artist what gifs can transmit that other mediums can’t, her answer is concise but complete: “Eternity.”\n\nIt wasn’t long ago that gifs were bi-products of longer stories. Now the democratized short stories dictate the cadence of music videos and carve eternal moments into our collective imagination. For her gifs Dyan manipulates light to create movement. “I’ve spend a lot of time figuring out a natural rhythm for gifs so I ended up using a lot of light gimmicks.” she told me over the phone. In some of the gifs she’s created, her subject matters, often musicians and models, stay still while the light carries on a full day’s worth of movement. Light is in fact a theme across Dyan’s work as a photographer, director and installation artist. Last year, she presented “Resilience”, a large-scale installation in Los Angeles’ Chinatown where 8000 beams each representing one hundred of the estimated 800,000 Dreamers enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as of 2017 filtered through holes in a makeshift wall.\n\nGrowing up in Temple City, a suburb east of Los Angeles, Dyan was more interested in the anime and manga she and her sister devoured over the summer and the virtual-world science games she spent hours on than school. “I don’t really have that many formative memories of school. That’s the reason why I ended up in my own head.” By the time she was ten, she already had a website she built using the computer her dad had assembled for her. A true child of the internet who has seen digital possibilities amplify, it’s no wonder Dyan is herself interested in stretching and distorting those limits through image and space.\n\nDirector: Frances Capell\nProducer: Burning Film / Ryland Burns\nExecutive Producers: Rob Stone, Jon Cohen, Andy Cohn, Anthony Holland\nCreative Director: Scott Perry\nDirector of Photography: Mikey Van Beuren\nAssistant Camera: Loren Hamilton\nSound Recordist: Jake Viator\nProduction Manager: Madison LaClair\nAssociate Producer: Claire Lilly\nProduction Assistants: Lindsey Hartman, Tyler Evans\nEditor: Andrew Sales\nTitles: Louis-Philippe Riel\nAnimation: Nik Shah\nColor: Dimitri Rajapakse at MPCLA\nSound Mix: Jake Viator\n\nSubscribe now for more The FADER  http://bit.ly/XPZVfG\n\nRead the FADER: http://www.thefader.com\nFollow the FADER on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thefader\nLike the FADER on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/11JaNSJ\nFollow the FADER on Tumblr: http://bit.ly/xerObW","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3H0gjYjpCU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3H0gjYjpCU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3H0gjYjpCU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3H0gjYjpCU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3H0gjYjpCU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The FADER","playlistId":"UURCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"X3H0gjYjpCU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/7oN3EWGoFKMTmX8ety7Anvz5YaQ\"","id":"VVVSQ09DdmZPa29xbmV5UUNiTk9VUHdnLjcxa0x0VWJBRHVj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-27T19:02:22.000Z","channelId":"UCRCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","title":"Keys N Krates - Music To My Ears ft.

The project was a way for Rothman to express themself, and their nine alter egos. \n\nNow the Laurel Canyon artist is back with a new film to even further explore that idea. Feast of Faces features many different iterations of Rothman, some bald, some with ornate jewelry and perfectly applied hot pink lipstick. Rothman, who is non binary, \"wanted to explore the idea of the many voices that inhabit one's mind throughout the day.\"\n\n\"Some of my friends say their inner “demons” have very distinct voices- some say they speak in their own voice,\" said Rothman, about the different voices their multiple characters take on in the film. \"Mine take on a sort of Southern Missouri accent, one that many of my friends had growing up and that I had until I moved to Chicago at 17.\"\n\n\"We all have those little good and bad voices that run through our minds that help us make decisions,\" explained Rothman. \"The inner critic that critique’s our art or job performance, tells us if we look good or ugly, injects self-doubt, or rarely sometimes confidence… and so on.\"\n\nThe film, which is exclusively premiering at The FADER, has an element of universality. The viewer is seeing Rothman, and their inner voices, but the conversations had at the table in Feast of Faces could be familiar to many. \n\n\"When you're all alone at home, do you really like what you see,\" asks one iteration of Rothman to the others. And for Rothman, that's the idea. They wanted the viewer to feel at ease with their inner voices. \n\n\"This is a natural part of existence, you're not weird or going insane,\" they explained. \"Everyone has their many different inner selves and sides of themselves that maybe come out in real life around different people or situations. Whatever the case is, in the modern world of constant judgment via social media it's easy for anyone whatever age to develop an extreme self-consciousness and low self-esteem via the many voices that inhabit the outside world. These can translate into voices that then inhabit your inside thoughts and constantly torment you're every decision. \"\n\nThe film wasn't only for others to feel at ease with their inner selves. Rothman found the experience to be cathartic for them as well, an opportunity to give their inner voices the space to conversate without suffocating Rothman. \n\n\"I have taken the nonsense chatter of all my inner voices and had them come alive on camera,\" they explained. \"I have them all debating the nonsensical vomit chatter with each other for once instead of debating with the real me. As Carl Jung said which is so fucking true, 'The Pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.' The body on the table was inspired by The Cook The Wife The Thief and her Lover is a metaphor for the real-life vessel that these sub subconscious voices inhabit.\"\n\n\nDirector: Lawrence Rothman + Scott Perry\nProducer: Coleen Haynes\nProduction Company: MAAVVEN\nEditor: Clark Eddy\nScore by: Cubby and Lawrence Rothman\nSpecial FX Makeup: Alley McGillicuddy \nHair: Pamela Neal\nMakeup: Kathy Jeung \nWardrobe: Douglas Vanlangingham\nCinematography Jordan Black\n\nCAST: \nLawrence Rothman- Aleister, Christopher, Kevin, Elizabeth \nNantucket - Andrea Burr\nAlester - Ryan Walker\nChristopher - Danny Axley\nKevin - Savannah Harrison\nElizabeth - Ty Wells\nCat - Jasmine Albuquerque\n\n\nSubscribe now for more The FADER  http://bit.ly/XPZVfG\n\nRead the FADER: http://www.thefader.com\nFollow the FADER on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thefader\nLike the FADER on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/11JaNSJ\nFollow the FADER on Tumblr: http://bit.ly/xerObW","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JekZW_f0S2A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JekZW_f0S2A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JekZW_f0S2A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JekZW_f0S2A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JekZW_f0S2A/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The FADER","playlistId":"UURCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","position":31,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"JekZW_f0S2A"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/c8goDzRea8r_u8kUJo-jcS64zHo\"","id":"VVVSQ09DdmZPa29xbmV5UUNiTk9VUHdnLl96QzAtbThlNjZv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-26T17:49:46.000Z","channelId":"UCRCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","title":"Rae Sremmurd - Powerglide - Live at FADER FORT (VR180)","description":"On the very last night of FADER FORT 2018, Rae Sremmurd showed up for a surprise set.

But they can come here, skate, and be themselves.” \n\nHere is Babylon LA, a combination “skate shop, gallery, hangout, and youth center” that Spielman founded in 2012 as a way to give the community of kids, punks, and outsiders that surrounded his band a real home - the kind of home that shaped him growing up. As Lee tells it, “For me right now, it’s all about taking the things I loved as a kid, and using the resources we have now to do my own version of it.”\n\n“If we could inspire kids to go out and just do whatever the fuck they want, that’s amazing. We all had that spot when we were a kid. And hopefully this spot is that for these kids.”\n\nShot on site on the L.A. streets that surround Babylon, the documentary captures the energy and spirit that led a legendary local punk band to become an essential part of their community, now and for years to come.

During this precious chunk of time off from school, adults are often out of sight, even further out of mind, and friends become the most important people on the planet. As you skate, swim, or chill through the days, there’s the opportunity of getting to know your pals — and yourself — better than ever.\n\nThat’s the journey Summer ’17, a new short film by Illegal Civilization and The FADER, captures. Shot on location in North Hollywood and Burbank, California, Summer ’17 follows Jeffery, played by Ryder McLaughlin, as he tries to win over a summer crush.\n\nProduced by Malcolm Washington, directed by Illegal Civ’s Mikey Alfred, and shot by Ayinde Anderson, the film had a lot of young, black creatives who worked behind the lens to bring this film to life. \nFeaturing cameos from Civ friends like Tyler, the Creator, and Aminé, every scene takes place across the IRL teen hangouts of Alfred’s youth. It’s the skate brand and film crew’s biggest production to date. It beautifully captures the simultaneous “WTF” internal turmoil and heart-fluttering magic of growing up and figuring your shit out.

Portmore born and raised, Masicka has been on the dancehall scene since he was a teenager, and has slowly been making a name for himself and his Genahsyde crew. In recent years, songs like ”Top Striker” and “Everything Mi Want / To The Top,“ have shown his ability to tell vivid stories of the streets and his rise to the top. Coupled with his undeniably versatile melodic sensibility and punch-to-the-gut delivery, it’s clear Masicka is a musical force to be reckoned with, in Jamaica and beyond.\n\nShot in Portmore, Jamaica, Energy follows Masicka as he tells the story of his rise, his spin on dancehall, and the genre’s importance to Jamaica.

With the NBA season about to tip off, Shaun Livingston dropped by The FADER for a word association exercise about his memories from each team he's played for, from the strictly enforced dress code with the Miami Heat to playing against Michael Jordan in practice with the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nhttp://www.thefader.com/2017/10/17/shaun-livingston-word-association-video\n\nSubscribe now for more The FADER  http://bit.ly/XPZVfG\n\nRead the FADER: http://www.thefader.com\nFollow the FADER on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thefader\nLike the FADER on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/11JaNSJ\nFollow the FADER on Tumblr: http://bit.ly/xerObW","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzjLfcqu-Q0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzjLfcqu-Q0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzjLfcqu-Q0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzjLfcqu-Q0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzjLfcqu-Q0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The FADER","playlistId":"UURCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","position":87,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"GzjLfcqu-Q0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/6IT_IYchLUMFPjPRlQmJ8zVdLaY\"","id":"VVVSQ09DdmZPa29xbmV5UUNiTk9VUHdnLjFtLUlEWEpPR1A0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-12T19:13:32.000Z","channelId":"UCRCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","title":"OriginalFani - I Don't Even Rap","description":"This summer, The FADER hung out with OriginalFani in Atlanta to shoot the latest installment of our I Don’t Even Rap series, highlighting behind-the-scenes players in rap.\n\nThere’s this bandana that your favorite Atlanta artists keep wearing. It comes in a few colors and is patterned with solid white dots and encircled “F” logos. That bandana, or “Fan-dana” as it’s better known, is the creation of 27-year-old graphic designer, stylist, and all-around creative mind Original Fani, who also runs an Atlanta-based clothing and design brand of the same name. The popularity of his bandanas —seen on the likes of Rae Sremmurd, SahBabii, and Lil Yachty, to name a few — are a telling symbol of Fani’s reach and influence within the southern rap hub.\n\nOver the course of a day-long shoot, with cameos from rapper Kodie Shane and photographer Cam Kirk, the designer explained to us how he got his start in the music industry working with Atlanta favorites like Two-9, Gucci Mane, and others, before turning his focus to clothing design. Now, with his Original Fani brand, he hopes to “tell stories about all things Atlanta, and spread that around the world” — especially right now. “It seems like the whole world is paying attention.”\n\nhttp://www.thefader.com/2017/10/12/original-fani-doc-fader-bandana-atlanta\n\nSubscribe now for more The FADER  http://bit.ly/XPZVfG\n\nRead the FADER: http://www.thefader.com\nFollow the FADER on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thefader\nLike the FADER on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/11JaNSJ\nFollow the FADER on Tumblr: http://bit.ly/xerObW\n\nDirector: Scott Perry\nProducer: Mario Kristian\nAssociate Producer: Nazuk Kochhar\nCreative Director: Rob Semmer\nExecutive Producers: Rob Stone, Jon Cohen, Andy Cohn,\nProduction Manager: Madison LaClair\nDirector of Photography: Scott Perry\nEditor: Chris Beckman, Mario Kristian\nProduction Assistant: Ethan Holland\nSound Recordist: Gridlife Film & Photo LLC","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1m-IDXJOGP4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1m-IDXJOGP4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1m-IDXJOGP4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1m-IDXJOGP4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1m-IDXJOGP4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The FADER","playlistId":"UURCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","position":88,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"1m-IDXJOGP4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/rtrS7M6xdW5JxKB4KMW5yVo3-98\"","id":"VVVSQ09DdmZPa29xbmV5UUNiTk9VUHdnLnVzU0FBci11UXkw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-11T21:48:12.000Z","channelId":"UCRCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","title":"Hoodrich Pablo Juan - Ranks His Top 5 Designer Brands","description":"The master sensei Hoodrich Pablo Juan just released his new project Designer Drugz 3, and the Atlanta native stopped by The FADER office to discuss his favorite designer clothing brands.

Watch Chromeo tell the story of Fancy Footwork above, where they also hint at what we might be able to hear from them in the future.\n\nhttp://www.thefader.com/2017/10/06/chromeo-fancy-footwork-interview-10-year-anniversary\n\nSubscribe now for more The FADER  http://bit.ly/XPZVfG\n\nRead the FADER: http://www.thefader.com\nFollow the FADER on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thefader\nLike the FADER on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/11JaNSJ\nFollow the FADER on Tumblr: http://bit.ly/xerObW\n\nDirector: Frances Capell\nProducer: Frances Capell\nCreative Director: Rob Semmer\nExecutive Producers: Rob Stone, Jon Cohen, Andy Cohn\nProduction Manager: Madison LaClair\nDirector of Photography: Andrew Sales\nSound Recordist: Jose Gallo\nEditor: Sam Balaban","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p-4WAYYrvCo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p-4WAYYrvCo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p-4WAYYrvCo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p-4WAYYrvCo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p-4WAYYrvCo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The FADER","playlistId":"UURCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","position":92,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"p-4WAYYrvCo"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/N79jtNAqsO3iGVB1Hg_LK8FgWK8\"","id":"VVVSQ09DdmZPa29xbmV5UUNiTk9VUHdnLmJveFVCNnV6UDFJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-05T22:25:35.000Z","channelId":"UCRCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","title":"Ts Madison's Very Important Horoscopes for October","description":"If you're feeling a little lost, there's no one better to show you a clear path than Ts Madison.

Honestly, for me it’s like 50% of the fun of traveling and being in a band,” says drummer Sam Hendricks. He’s only half joking. \n\nThe bandmates all spend a lot of time in Brooklyn, so they hooked up with New York's Blue Point Brewing Company and The FADER for a chance to escape the city and go deep into the best of what LI has to eat and drink. First stop: the iconic Jackson Diner, one of the very first Indian restaurants in Queens and standard bearer of the diverse food paradise that is NYC’s Jackson Heights neighborhood. Skip the pancakes and go for the naan instead, because this diner has one of the most legendary Indian buffets on the island.

It's a universal feeling that people way beyond the boarders of New York City can relate to.\nWatch the video above and keep an eye out for Squidnice's mixtape The Craccen.\n\nSubscribe now for more The FADER  http://bit.ly/XPZVfG\n\nRead the FADER: http://www.thefader.com\nFollow the FADER on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thefader\nLike the FADER on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/11JaNSJ\nFollow the FADER on Tumblr: http://bit.ly/xerObW\n\n\nDirector: Rob Semmer\nDirector of Photography: Scott Perry\nEditor: Sam Balaban","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oNWkpvVPejQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oNWkpvVPejQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oNWkpvVPejQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oNWkpvVPejQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oNWkpvVPejQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The FADER","playlistId":"UURCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","position":112,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oNWkpvVPejQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/DlBei4ScDpOOCVotgIpW7PjrJlU\"","id":"VVVSQ09DdmZPa29xbmV5UUNiTk9VUHdnLmhXcmlqNHUwV0J3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-11T19:32:00.000Z","channelId":"UCRCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","title":"How Big Boi Created His Timeless Classic “The Way You Move”","description":"During the recording of Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, Outkast's seminal 2003 double album, Big Boi and André 3000 were each holed up in different rooms in Atlanta's Stankonia Studios. \"After 'Dre did \"Hey Ya,\" I said, \"We're not finna do nothing regular,'\" Big Boi remembered during a recent visit to The FADER. \"The Way You Move,\" the lead single from his Speakerboxxx side of the record, perfectly captured the Atlanta rapper's smooth delivery and became a timeless hit.\n\nAs Big Boi explained, he had been sitting on the Carl Mo instrumental that would become his No. 1 single. \"I knew the song was a hit when I first heard the bare-bones track,\" he said. \"That's why I marinated on it for a couple years.\" In the video above, Big Boi recalls how the layers of the track came together, his vision for the video, and Fonzworth Bentley's memorable cameo.\n\nBoomiverse album out now!!! \n\nhttp://www.thefader.com/2017/07/11/big-boi-story-behind-the-way-you-move\n\nSubscribe now for more The FADER  http://bit.ly/XPZVfG\n\nRead the FADER: http://www.thefader.com\nFollow the FADER on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thefader\nLike the FADER on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/11JaNSJ\nFollow the FADER on Tumblr: http://bit.ly/xerObW","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWrij4u0WBw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWrij4u0WBw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWrij4u0WBw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWrij4u0WBw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWrij4u0WBw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The FADER","playlistId":"UURCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","position":113,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"hWrij4u0WBw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/r4PCMtL1y241f-Tpk90BtOpa7p4\"","id":"VVVSQ09DdmZPa29xbmV5UUNiTk9VUHdnLnlQdEJmWnFkclpF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-05T17:07:12.000Z","channelId":"UCRCOCvfOkoqneyQCbNOUPwg","title":"Lil Yachty - FADER Cover Story","description":"Can the king of teens thrive into his twenties?
