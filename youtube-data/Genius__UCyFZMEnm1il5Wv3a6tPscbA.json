His 2018 follow-up ? (Question Mark) debuted at No. 1 and spawned the hit single “SAD!,” which reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 2017, he was the single most popular new artist on Genius, earning over 20 million pageviews across all his songs.\n\nHis popularity was met with significant controversy, as he was awaiting trial on multiple felony charges, including battery and aggravated assault of a pregnant victim, battery by strangulation, and false imprisonment. Spotify sparked industry-wide debate earlier this year after it announced that it was removing his music from editorially curated playlists due to the charges. The move was quietly reversed shortly afterwards.\n\nDespite his disturbing personal conduct, XXX has been viewed as the most prominent voice in the emergent South Florida SoundCloud rap scene, which also includes rappers like Ski Mask The Slump God, Lil Pump, Smokepurpp, and ​​wifisfuneral.

Produced by X.L. and Nard & B, “Never Thought” is about letting go of the past and falling in love unexpectedly.\n\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/toni-romiti-dc-young-fly-break-down-official-lyrics-for-never-thought-on-genius-video-series-verified\n\nRead all the lyrics to “Never Thought” on Genius: https://genius.com/Toni-romiti-never-thought-lyricss:\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5HPYW6BYj6Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5HPYW6BYj6Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5HPYW6BYj6Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5HPYW6BYj6Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5HPYW6BYj6Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Genius","playlistId":"UUyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","position":196,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"5HPYW6BYj6Y"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/EduIHiPJWdqoxouhMql6bwh1nkg\"","id":"VVV5RlpNRW5tMWlsNVd2M2E2dFBzY2JBLjAyUWhoNUhqOF9J","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-30T21:05:15.000Z","channelId":"UCyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","title":"Is The Weeknd’s ‘My Dear Melancholy,’ About Selena Gomez? | Genius News","description":"The Weeknd’s new EP 'My Dear Melancholy,' finds the Toronto R&B star getting back to the dark, brooding sound that first made him famous, but many fans are more focused on who he’s singing about.

While the lyrics are in Spanish, the title is actually a word from the Papiamento language and the song is all about embracing your fun side.\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/j-balvin-breaks-down-official-lyrics-for-machika-on-genius-video-series-verified\n\nRead all the lyrics to \"Machika\" on Genius: https://genius.com/J-balvin-jeon-and-anitta-machika-lyrics\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ld56SX8d4qc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ld56SX8d4qc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ld56SX8d4qc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ld56SX8d4qc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ld56SX8d4qc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Genius","playlistId":"UUyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","position":267,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Ld56SX8d4qc"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/A2MCwRcvWFO0egV-6iRVz96B2_I\"","id":"VVV5RlpNRW5tMWlsNVd2M2E2dFBzY2JBLjBYdENuR1QwQjIw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-16T23:20:19.000Z","channelId":"UCyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","title":"The Making Of “Wakanda” With Ludwig Göransson | Presented By Marvel Studio’s Black Panther","description":"The highly-anticipated Black Panther film opens this week in theaters.

Dan made claims on Twitter that Atlantic Records paid him only half of his normal rate for his work on Wiz Khalifa’s 2016 album, 'Khalifa,' because it was classified as a mixtape. His revelation sparked conversations with other producers who aired their frustrations concerning royalties and payments from labels. This includes producer TM88 who tweeted that he was never paid for Lil Uzi Vert’s hit single, “XO TOUR Llif3.”\n\nAccording to an entertainment lawyer we interviewed, a major form of income for producers often comes from royalty advances, however, that’s not always plausible because mixtapes don’t usually have the same budgets as albums. Navigating producer deals and rates can seem overwhelmingly complex, but there are guidelines to follow. Check out the video above to learn how producers can protect their paychecks.\n\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/what-every-producer-should-know-about-getting-paid\n\nRead all the lyrics to “XO TOUR Llif3\" on Genius: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-xo-tour-llif3-lyrics\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haGokXM4rk0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haGokXM4rk0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haGokXM4rk0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haGokXM4rk0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haGokXM4rk0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Genius","playlistId":"UUyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","position":314,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"haGokXM4rk0"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/Qr02wUsyj9c-hGbMGy3QhgfRSPg\"","id":"VVV5RlpNRW5tMWlsNVd2M2E2dFBzY2JBLndtZjNrRVl2eV9F","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-01-16T22:52:28.000Z","channelId":"UCyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","title":"The Making Of Bryson Tiller's \"Exchange\" With Foreign Teck | Deconstructed","description":"Bryson Tiller first gained a following after sharing “Don’t,” a single off his 2015 debut 'T R A P S O U L' that currently holds over 300 million Spotify streams.

He’s also produced a slew of other hits, from Post Malone’s “Congratulations” to his own “No Complaints” featuring Offset and Drake.\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/why-metro-boomin-was-2017-s-most-prolific-hip-hop-producer\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/26cbnW7r-xQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/26cbnW7r-xQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/26cbnW7r-xQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/26cbnW7r-xQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/26cbnW7r-xQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Genius","playlistId":"UUyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","position":355,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"26cbnW7r-xQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/1F4AuSbclgv5-V1qyJhyr450MgM\"","id":"VVV5RlpNRW5tMWlsNVd2M2E2dFBzY2JBLnpWWWhlZmlTZG9n","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-06T17:17:28.000Z","channelId":"UCyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","title":"Smino \"Anita\" Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified","description":"In the run-up to the release of his debut album 'blkswn' earlier this year, St. Louis-based rapper Smino dropped his single “Anita.” The track is produced by Monte Booker, and is named after legendary singer-songwriter Anita Baker.

The Israelites are about to enter the land promised to them by God, and Moses gives them God’s holy law and warns of dire consequences should they break it.\n\nKendrick’s lyrics often delve into spiritual territory, but the Old Testament fire and brimstone is a new theme for him. Perhaps disillusioned by what many see as a dark turn in the country’s history, he is searching for roots by referencing the teachings of the Hebrew Israelites, a black religious movement that has thrived on the margins of the country’s spiritual landscape for over a century.\n\nLamar is not alone. Two months after the release of DAMN., Kodak Black echoed Kendrick’s lines on “First Day Out,” the first single he dropped after being released from prison.\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/inside-the-hebrew-israelite-movement-that-s-inspiring-kendrick-lamar-kodak-black\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZBnHJCB3VZE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZBnHJCB3VZE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZBnHJCB3VZE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZBnHJCB3VZE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZBnHJCB3VZE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Genius","playlistId":"UUyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","position":529,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ZBnHJCB3VZE"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/SZCxYRcZVHsZeekh0e9oCm7x1MA\"","id":"VVV5RlpNRW5tMWlsNVd2M2E2dFBzY2JBLlpLTkxpbFJ3UHlz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-07T17:39:18.000Z","channelId":"UCyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","title":"Bishop Briggs \"The Way I Do\" Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified","description":"U.K.-born, Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Bishop Briggs first broke out with the success of her Gold-certified 2015 single \"River,\" but lately her song \"The Way I Do\" has also been gaining steam.

While the talkbox and vocoder give songs a retro feel, Auto-Tune was originally used on futuristic pop hits. In 1998, Cher’s “Believe” was one of the first commercial recordings to use the effect. In 1999 Jennifer Lopez released her No. 1 hit “If You Had My Love.” Inspired by J. Lo, T-Pain took Auto-Tune to the next level.\n\nOn his 2005 debut, T-Pain used it to distort his vocals, rather than just pitch-correct them. In 2007, Snoop Dogg embraced the effect on “Sexual Eruption.” In 2008, Lil Wayne adopted the technique for 'Tha Carter III.' Later that year, Kanye dropped his Auto-Tuned '808s & Heartbreak.' But then in 2009, JAY-Z announced his desire to kill the effect with “D.O.A. (Death Of Auto-Tune).” Since then, there have been protests… but the effect has persevered.\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/the-history-of-auto-tune\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oS4Gku99Qco/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oS4Gku99Qco/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oS4Gku99Qco/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oS4Gku99Qco/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oS4Gku99Qco/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Genius","playlistId":"UUyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","position":555,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oS4Gku99Qco"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/KnvDVn9EGD_f3rD-TI1xBqof8Pg\"","id":"VVV5RlpNRW5tMWlsNVd2M2E2dFBzY2JBLjhlWVE1cl9xWVNN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-19T17:53:46.000Z","channelId":"UCyFZMEnm1il5Wv3a6tPscbA","title":"Sevyn Streeter \"Before I Do\" Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified","description":"Earlier this month, Sevyn Streeter released her debut studio album titled Girl Disrupted.
