And Tony (with special guest: Ross Smith) makes his latest effort to capture the temporary attention of millions by playing football the traditional way (forwards) before rewinding it back in reverse. The result is an open-field dash that would make Barry Sanders jealous, especially if he got to carry a sword onto the field, and also played in an office with stairs. After that we got a peek at some custom sneakers, first inspired by Russell Westbrook, then put together by artist/designer Julian Gaines, and finally improved slightly with after-the-fact collaborations by Tony and Zoe.

What resulted was a parkour demonstration that was less than stellar, but at least it looked good when it was all put together. That counts for something. We also un-boxed some Fila Mind Blowers, and got a look at some Air Jordan 11s that you could wear to Prom (or some more adult event) and still pull off. Finally we said good-bye to Rich Maze Lopez who, on his last day, became a certified expert on all things sneakers, and also left us with some short but sweet life advice that we should all at least consider following.\n\nSubscribe to Complex on YouTube: https://goo.gl/43ac5w\nCheck out more of Complex here:\nhttp://www.complex.com\nhttps://twitter.com/Complex\nhttps://www.facebook.com/complex\nhttp://instagram.com/complex\nhttps://plus.google.com/+complex/\n\nCOMPLEX is a community of creators and curators, armed with the Internet, committed to surfacing and sharing the voices and conversations that define our new America.
